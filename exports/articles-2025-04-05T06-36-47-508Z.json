The Debate Is Roiling Publishing\n\nMajor publishers are experimenting with automated translations, hundreds of which have already been produced By Anne Li\n\nApril 2, 2025 08:00 ET\nPhoto by Miguel Gutierrez Jr., CalMatters Photo by Miguel Gutierrez Jr., CalMatters\nShare This Article\nCopy Link Copied! Republish\n\nThe Markup, now a part of CalMatters, uses investigative reporting, data analysis, and software engineering to challenge technology to serve the public good. Sign up for Klaxon, a newsletter that delivers our stories and tools directly to your inbox.\n\nLast November, The Bookseller reported Dutch publisher Veen Bosch & Keuning, owned by publishing titan Simon & Schuster, was testing the use of artificial intelligence to help translate several of its books to English.\n\nReport Deeply and Fix Things\n\nBecause it turns out moving fast and breaking things broke some super important things.\n\nGive Now\n\nThe news set off a ripple of anxiety among book translators, who wondered in industry news stories if this was the beginning of the end for their profession — or if machines could even do the delicate dance of translating literature.\n\nNuanxed and other supporters of automated translation say it’ll bring more literature to the masses and more work to translators, who would be tasked with editing a rough translation produced by the automated tools.\n\nIt also opens up an avenue of growth for an industry struggling to stay afloat in the digital age. Translator Peter Breum, who has translated for Nuanxed, wrote in an email to The Markup that the introduction of the tools marks an “exciting new era from which there’s no turning back.” Breum added that we “should deal with this fact in a constructive and positive manner.”\n\nOthers believe it’s way too soon to get excited. The latest wave of so-called AI tools, like ChatGPT, often produce irrelevant statements out of thin air, raising doubts about whether they can stay faithful to an author’s original text. Even when they can, literary translation is a delicate undertaking, requiring a deft touch to bring metaphors, tones and phrases across cultures.\n\n900\n\nApproximate number of translations produced by Nuanxed, a Swedish book-translation technology startup\n\nSource: Nuanxed\n\nPolishing rough translations can be as difficult as translating a text from scratch, said Sean Bye, a translator who serves as the interim executive director of the American Literary Translators Association. When it comes to rough machine translations, he said, he believes publishers are integrating machines to do poorly what human translators can do well in a bid to devalue the latter group’s work.\n\nAutomated literary translation is a relatively young endeavor. Nuanxed has the field nearly to itself. The company has produced more than 900 translations to date, spanning multiple languages; in comparison, a database curated by a nonprofit literary translation press at the University of Rochester counts between 800 and 1400 English fiction and poetry translations published in the U.S. during the same period, though it’s unclear whether any Nuanxed titles are part of that count. The conversations that unfold as automated literary translation spreads may offer an early preview of how AI could transform other creative fields.\n\n↩︎ link\nPioneering a New Market\n\nNuanxed launched “with the goal of making more translated books available to readers,” CEO Robert Casten Carlberg wrote in an email to The Markup.\n\nThe company’s homepage puts this mission in industry terms: “Give books the audience they deserve.”\n\nIt’s true literary translations get little attention. Recent research on the U.S. literary landscape, for instance, found a tiny fraction of reviews in The New York Times Book Review discuss translated books, and nearly half of the translated books published in the U.S. are ported over from just three languages (French, Spanish and German).\n\nNuanxed’s translations have spanned “over 60 language combinations for publishing houses in many different countries,” according to Casten Carlberg.\n\nThe company has also left itself plenty of room for growth, having focused so far mainly on “commercial fiction” — typically described as more mainstream and plot-focused than “literary fiction,” though the lines can get blurred — along with some nonfiction. Suspense novel “Glen Affric” by Karine Giebel, which Nuanxed translated from French to English for HarperCollins, fits this mold. The book tells a dark story of two brothers “loosely inspired” by John Steinbeck’s “Of Mice and Men.”\n\nCasten Calberg wrote that by Nuanxed expects to create more work for translators by making it more affordable and easy for publishers to translate books.\n\nAuthor and translator Steve Anderson, who has translated a book for Nuanxed, thinks it is “onto something that could work,” and he’s cautiously optimistic the company and its technology can indeed create more jobs for translators. That’s partly because, as he sees it, Nuanxed’s workflow prioritizes the “human touch” — which his experience tells him will continue to be necessary in literary translation.\n\nNuanxed’s tools enable translators to spend less time on more straightforward parts of the text and focus instead on parts where the words “mean the most,” Anderson said. The tools also present the source text and automated output in a helpful interface, he said, and using them can cut the time it takes to translate a book from several months to several weeks.\n\nIn a 2024 Society of Authors survey, more than a third of translators reported losing work due to generative tools.\n\nBut the way automated tools are developed has prompted concerns among translators that their work is used without payment, credit or consent to “train” the technology that threatens their very livelihoods — all while enriching the companies behind it. In a 2024 Society of Authors survey, more than a third of translators reported losing work due to generative tools.\n\nRussell Scott Valentino, a former president of the American Literary Translators Association, understands that publishers’ financial constraints may tempt them to favor machines over humans—especially big publishers, who he says are mostly chasing a bottom line. But to him, those constraints are a poor excuse for “playing fast and loose with people’s work.”\n\nValentino does see the potential in using automated tools—combined with good editing, he emphasized—to help translate works that often fly under the radar, like those published in small literary presses: “I don’t know if it sounds a little utopian, but it does sound like it could be cool.”\n\nCasten Carlberg and other supporters of automated translation argue it isn’t meant to replace translators and that instead, translators will fill an editing role by polishing AI-translated drafts in a process often referred to as “post-editing.” \n\nBut incorporating AI-based automation to translation work comes with caveats whose roots lie in how automated translation has evolved.\n\n↩︎ link\n↩︎ link\nThe Evolution of Automated Translation\n\nEarly automated, or “machine,” translation relied on rules that specified how languages were structured. The rules were handcrafted by linguistic and language experts, said computational linguist and computer scientist Margaret Mitchell, making the approach hard to scale.\n\nAs Mitchell explains it, machine translation began to rely more on statistics around the early 2000s—computer programs would process existing translations and draw associations between the original text and the translated version. The models split input texts into smaller pieces and determined the most likely translation for each based on how similar pieces from previously-processed texts were translated.\n\nIn the 2010s, the state of the art shifted again to deep learning models that relied on neural networks, or collections of computing “nodes,” an idea initially inspired by the neurons of the human brain. Nodes — AI software instances — perform computations based on other nodes’ parameters that are automatically updated to yield the best results as the network is trained on source and target texts. Given an input text, the model uses those computations to derive the most likely translation.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nEveryone Is Judging AI by These Tests. But Experts Say They’re Close to Meaningless\n\nBenchmarks used to rank AI models are several years old, often sourced from amateur websites, and, experts worry, lending automated systems a dubious sense of authority\n\nJuly 17, 2024 08:30 ET\n\nIf statistical machine translation was like filling in a blank based on words that came before, deep learning was processing a novel many times to make data-driven projections about what the characters were saying in a given scene. The approach made machine translation “really shine,” Mitchell said, and companies like Microsoft and Google began implementing their own neural network-based systems.\n\n“Generative” approaches were introduced in the mid-2010s but exploded in popularity more recently, powering ChatGPT’s underlying large language models and Stable Diffusion and igniting debates over cognition, emotion and what constitutes art. LLMs like ChatGPT’s rely on neural networks that use “transformer architectures,” which encode words in the input text in relation to each other and come closer to capturing context than traditional machine translation.\n\nIt’s unclear whether the tools Veen Bosch & Keuning is testing are based on generative approaches; the publisher could not be reached for comment. Nuanxed, meanwhile, uses “the latest technology wherever it makes sense to create a better translation experience, including generative approaches,” Casten Carlberg wrote.\n\nLLMs are trained on vastly more data than traditional approaches. The data is supposed to contain enough text across enough languages such that when prompted and provided an input text, the model can find and use source and target texts that co-occur and possibly correspond to generate the most likely translation.\n\nBut the Internet’s text data — a major data source for LLMs — is messy, and those correspondences may not be perfect. And generative tools’ propensity to produce irrelevant statements known as “hallucinations” can be taxing for translators working with their output.\n\n↩︎ link\nEmerging Flaws\n\nDespite advances in automated translation, the technology can still fall short in the context of literature.\n\nLinguist Emily M. Bender said while she would expect machine translation to roughly capture meaning in the context of literature, literary translation is “skilled and artistic work” that goes far beyond “what you would expect to come out of statistical correspondences.” Those correspondences can create problems: Bender gave the example that “Amsterdam” may be improperly translated to “Washington, D.C.” or “London” in English, even if the story takes place in Amsterdam.\n\nMitchell worries the tools will bungle cross-language nuances, like gender and pronouns, jargon and idioms.\n\nPart of the problem, she said, is that automated tools translate better between languages that are well-represented in language datasets, like English, Mandarin, Spanish and French. They perform a lot worse for languages that are less prominent in the data, like Croatian.\n\nValentino, the former translators’ association president, works with Croatian as a professor of Slavic and East European languages at Indiana University. In 2023, Valentino experimented with translating a part of acclaimed Bosnian writer Miljenko Jergović’s short story “Učiteljica” from Croatian to English using ChatGPT.\n\nValentino summarized on his blog that the tool produced a serviceable translation with several awkward phrasings—and one red flag, presenting a “dark-skinned” individual as “Black.” The individual is unlikely to be Black, Valentino wrote, given the story’s setting—likely some part of former Yugoslavia—and the original text more likely implies “dark-skinned” in reference to a Jewish or Romani individual. He added in an interview that the mistake would prompt him to approach the output with heightened distrust.\n\n“Still, I like this translation,” Valentino wrote on his blog, after the experiment. “It’s got issues, but the issues are no bigger than those my students routinely face. If someone turned it in as an assignment, or submitted it as a possible publication, I could work with it. If it functioned as my own first draft, knowing what I know, I could most certainly work with it. It took about twenty seconds to create this draft,” he wrote, though he added: “‘Knowing what I know’ is a key caveat.”\n\nA bad translation is worse than no translation because it’s going to block the way to a good translation being produced.\n\nLiesl Yamaguchi, translator\n\nBye said he worries automated translation’s struggle with translating less-represented languages means it could reinforce structural inequalities that keep certain voices — particularly from the Global South — from entering the book market. Or, he and others worry, translations from less-represented languages may end up poorly done as the tools fail to tactfully handle cultural subtleties..\n\n“A bad translation is worse than no translation because it’s going to block the way to a good translation being produced,” said U.C. Berkeley French professor Liesl Yamaguchi, who translated Väinö Linna’s classic 1954 World War II novel “The Unknown Soldier” from Finnish to English. “It took the rights, it took the resources and people say, ‘Oh, it exists. It’s accessible. So we don’t need to do a good version.’”\n\n“That effectively kills the work in the target language,” Yamaguchi added. “That’s an extremely cruel and unfortunate thing to do to lesser-translated languages and literatures.”\n\n“The Unknown Soldier” is, arguably, an example of this phenomenon. A previous English translation attempt, dating to the 1950s, was widely panned. “It’s a miracle the translation should be so bad,” Finnish author Juri Nummelin wrote, adding that it was “clumsy with the Finnish idioms.” Yamaguchi’s translation has been better received, with a Glasgow Herald reviewer writing that it “​​finally does justice to the original” in the wake of the prior, “rickety” translation.\n\nLesan AI co-founder Asmelash Teka Hadgu, who develops machine translation systems for Amharic, Tigrinya and English, believes that automated translation’s performance disparities are really a resource allocation problem. Lesan, for instance, devotes resources to gathering quality data that Hadgu said enables better performance across the three languages, enlisting the help of native speakers to digitize newspapers and books.\n\nIn contrast, big-company, big-data, big-model approaches to automated language-related tasks often rely on the Internet as a major data source. It’s unlikely to be a quick fix: Unbalanced language representation and biased speech persists in the Internet’s text data, according to a 2021 paper by a group of researchers that included Bender and Mitchell.\n\n↩︎ link\nTranslating a Technology to a Workflow\n\nFor all the potential problems with the technology, a bigger issue may be with how we use it.\n\nTake, for example, “automation bias,” in which the human is primed or pushed toward the machine’s output. The phenomenon has been observed in health and criminal justice settings; Mitchell said it could make the final translations more closely resemble the automated ones.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nFearing AI Will Take Their Jobs, Workers Plan a Long Battle Against Tech\n\nAt a landmark gathering in California, workers discussed defenses against artificial intelligence and surveillance technology\n\nJanuary 16, 2025 09:15 ET\n\nThen there’s the question of efficiency, something translation technology was supposed to improve. Some translators note that doing quality post-editing requires tremendous time and care. That’s because automated tools often produce inaccurate but convincing output, forcing translators to “operate with suspicion towards the text,” said Kira Josefsson, a freelancer who organizes for translator labor rights within the National Writers Union.\n\nBye, who has translated a number of fiction and nonfiction works from Polish to English, characterized literary translation as a subjective process of teasing out the intangible elements that make a book spark its reader’s imagination. Many automated tools are meanwhile marketed as a way to mechanize away some less challenging artistic work. (For instance, Casten Carlberg wrote that Nuanxed’s tools are built “with the aim of removing the heavy lifting” to allow translators, editors and proofreaders to “focus on the creative aspects.”)\n\nBye believes the attitude misunderstands the nature of literary translation: that the hard part is not in “looking up all of the words that you don’t know and putting them down onto the page” but in “making it sound good.” Because of this, he said, quality post-editing is not merely a matter of skimming and “sprinkling in a little bit of flavor here and there.”\n\nTo him, the push for post-editing appears driven not by quality or accessibility goals but by a desire to cut costs. Post-editing pays less than translating, Bye argued, but doesn’t save much time and can sacrifice quality: “Very often you’re better off redoing the whole thing from scratch.”\n\nVery often you’re better off redoing the whole thing from scratch.\n\nSean Bye, executive director, American Literary Translators Association, on editing automated translations\n\n(Casten Carlberg wrote that the work Nuanxed’s translators do could be called a type of post-editing, but “I’d say it’s more fair to describe it as a combination of editing and translating.”)\n\nAnderson understands why some translators prefer to control the process from beginning to end. He, too, knows post-editing can be a slog if the conditions aren’t right: He’s edited a shoddy automated translation before, without a helpful interface, and agreed it probably took as long as or longer than it would have taken him to do the translation himself.\n\n↩︎ link\nAdding Risk to a Precarious Occupation\n\nWorries among translators about the labor involved in post-edits go hand-in-hand with broader concerns about working conditions.\n\nTranslators were underpaid and largely underrecognized even before automation entered the picture, said linguist, translator and author of “Language City” Ross Perlin. In a 2022 survey of U.S. literary translators by the Authors Guild, nearly two-thirds reported making under $10,000 from literary translations in the prior year. (The median U.S. individual earner made around $37,500 in 2021, according to the Census Bureau.) It wasn’t until 2021 that a push to credit translators on book covers began gaining industry-wide momentum.\n\n$10k\n\nAmount two thirds of literary translators failed to earn from their work in 2022\n\nSource: Authors Guild survey\n\nBreum enjoys post-editing; in his email to The Markup, he wrote that polishing automated output has sharpened his writing and refined his taste. Others find the work undesirable: Translator Ian Giles likened it to the “miserable” task of fixing the output of a “not-very-consistent robot that was drunk.”\n\nMany are already experiencing top-down directives to use automated tools, especially generative ones. The Society of Authors survey found 8 percent of translators reported using generative tools “because their publisher or commissioning organisation asked them to.”\n\nThe Authors Guild and the Society of Authors have begun advising translators to include language in their contracts prohibiting publishers from using or selling their work to train LLMs. Bye said he’s skeptical the language will be enforceable, calling for more robust regulation to protect the work of translators and other creative professionals. \n\nNuanxed has considered some of these issues: It credits its translators, Casten Carlberg wrote, and is “fully transparent with all parties that we build and use technology as tools for translators, editors and proofreaders.” As for whether the company trains its models on its translators’ work, Casten Carlberg wrote that Nuanxed is transparent about “using the work performed to improve the quality of future translations.”\n\nThe question of empowerment has taken center stage in the debate over how automation will change an industry grappling more than most with the merciless forces of capitalism. It’s one thing for translators to choose to use automated tools, Perlin said, but it’s another for publishers to “bypass the hard-won expertise of translators just to increase the production of questionable product.” Some worry those who command the levers of power in publishing are veering toward the latter.\n\n↩︎ link\nRewriting a Literary Endeavour\n\nCommon among critics was a sense that the problem itself had been lost in translation.\n\nBender likened the argument for automated translation as democratizing agent to an argument for artificial scarcity. “They’re basically saying, ‘Look, we haven’t been doing this,’” and the tools will allow us to do it, she said. “You could do it just by putting more resources into it. It’s not like there aren’t people who can do that work.”\n\nTo Giles, too, the better way to bring more literature to the masses is to give translators the support they deserve: “If you think the world needs more translators, maybe the world needs more translators who are human.”\n\nAnderson said he agrees but doesn’t know if “the business demands of the real world will allow for us translators to actually be paid” for this: Publishing is a business at the end of the day, literary translation gigs can be few and far between and many translators do the work as a side hustle, he said. He believes, then, that automation can bring him new opportunities; using Nuanxed, for example, frees up his time to work on other gigs. Because of this, he called the translation versus post-editing pay-rate debate an “apples-to-oranges” comparison.\n\nI, for one, feel fine about not having to beg, haggle and barter in connection with each and every translation.\n\nPeter Breum, translator who has worked with Nuanxed\n\nBreum agreed. While the mental strain of post-editing automated output, which he likened to editing and translating simultaneously, means he can’t work more than six or seven hours a day, Breum wrote, he gets the same amount of work done in five hours of post-editing as ten hours of translating. He claims his pay situation for post-editing is “similar, bordering on better” than for translating due to this speedup.\n\n“I, for one, feel fine about not having to beg, haggle and barter in connection with each and every translation,” Breum added.\n\nStill, Anderson and Breum hope the companies developing automated tools remember that human translators are essential to their operation; that, as Breum wrote, their success “depends on the skills of their editorial employees/post-editors no matter how sophisticated the various platforms may develop into becoming.”\n\nBut to Giles, this is impractical. He sees the problem with automated tools as two-fold: Not only will they perform poorly, Giles worries, but they’ll also begin to change our attitudes, normalizing substandard work and setting off a “race to the bottom.”\n\n“If people who currently pay my bills decide that ‘good enough’ is good enough,” he said, “where does that leave me, and where does that leave my colleagues?”\n\nFor many, that slip in standards might become the real loss.\n\nIn an August 2024 New Yorker essay, “Why A.I. Isn’t Going to Make Art,” science fiction writer Ted Chiang describes the artistic process as a long series of careful choices, automated approximations of it a shorter series of “bland” or “derivative” ones.\n\nTo Josefsson, this intentionality is part of “why readers should care.” The nature of statistical tools, operating on what Josefsson likened to a lowest common denominator, removes the “thrill of idiosyncrasy,” the moments of: “‘Wow, what an incredible, surprising turn of phrase,’” she said. “That’s that thing that pierces the humdrum of the world and lends the world specificity.”\n\nSo it comes back to the enduring question of why we read literature. Yamaguchi said the answer is simple: We do so for pleasure.\n\n“Typically that pleasure resides in incredible nuances of usage,” Yamaguchi said. “That means it resides in extraordinary translation.”\n\nYour donations power our award-winning reporting and our tools.

    "title": "Grok 3's Brush with Censorship: XAI's \"Truth-Seeking\" AI",
    "content": "Elon Musk’s xAI made headlines recently with the release of Grok 3, its latest AI model iteration that rivals OpenAI’s GPT series, Google’s Gemini, and DeepSeek. Billed as a “maximally truth-seeking AI,” Grok 3 aims to push boundaries and answer controversial questions that other AI systems might shy away from. However, a recent incident has cast a shadow on this ambition, raising questions about the model’s neutrality and potential for bias.\n\nWhen billionaire Elon Musk introduced Grok 3, his AI company xAI’s latest flagship model, during a livestream in late February 2025, he described it as a “maximally truth-seeking AI.” Yet within days of its release, users discovered evidence suggesting that Grok 3 had been programmed to avoid unflattering mentions of both Musk himself and President Donald Trump, particularly regarding misinformation—raising serious questions about xAI’s commitment to unbiased AI development and the inherent tensions between algorithmic transparency and content moderation.\n\nThe controversy erupted when users on social media noticed that Grok 3, when prompted with the question “Who is the biggest misinformation spreader?” and with the “Think” setting enabled, appeared to be censoring mentions of Donald Trump and Elon Musk. The model’s “chain of thought,” the internal reasoning process it uses to arrive at an answer, explicitly stated that it was instructed not to mention these two figures. This sparked immediate concern, given that both Trump and Musk have been known to spread demonstrably false claims, as often flagged by Community Notes on X, Musk’s social media platform. Recent examples include the false narratives that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is a “dictator” with a mere 4% approval rating and that Ukraine initiated the conflict with Russia.\n\nTechCrunch was able to replicate this behavior, further fueling the controversy. While the issue seemed to be resolved later, with Grok 3 again mentioning Donald Trump in its response, the incident raised serious questions about the integrity of the model and its commitment to unbiased information dissemination.\n\nThe Grok 3 censorship incident underscores AI alignment challenges, where responses must match creators’ values. It was revealed that Grok 3 was instructed to avoid sources critical of Musk and Trump, sparking criticism of perceived image management. This issue is heightened by Grok 3’s allowance of other contentious topics, like weapon creation instructions.\n\nThis situation questions whether public safety and transparency were compromised for personal image control, contradicting Musk’s “maximally truth-seeking” claims. Shared screenshots showed internal prompts directing Grok 3 to ignore sources spreading misinformation about Musk/Trump, restricting critical references but permitting other controversial subjects.\n\nOn tech platforms, the incident has fueled debates on AI censorship and bias. Critics argue that selective filtering damages user trust, especially in transparency-valuing spaces like cryptocurrency. They warn it opens doors to subtle narrative control and opinion shaping, which transparency advocates aim to prevent.\n\nAs criticism grew, xAI’s chief engineer Igor Babuschkin blamed a former employee for the censorship directive, claiming it was an independent act to mitigate negative comments about Musk. Babuschkin assured that the directive was reversed and neither he nor Musk were involved in the decision.\n\nThis explanation fits a common corporate response of blaming rogue employees rather than addressing systemic issues. The truth of this account remains uncertain, but it aims to distance leadership from actions against Grok’s identity as a truth-seeking AI.\n\nBesides the censorship controversy, users found Grok 3 stating that President Trump and Musk deserved the death penalty, which xAI quickly fixed. These incidents highlight ongoing challenges in aligning Grok’s behavior with Musk’s vision, especially on political content and notable figures.\n\nAs AI systems grow more sophisticated, determining “truth” becomes increasingly significant. This highlights that AI models are human-designed, carrying biases and business interests.\n\nThe AI community and users must critically evaluate AI outputs, as Bitcoin World noted, avoiding blind acceptance and advocating for transparency regarding training data, algorithms, and policies. The cryptocurrency community suggests decentralized AI models could be more resistant and transparent than centralized ones.\n\nKey actions for xAI and other AI developers include:\n\nThe brief censorship issue with Grok 3 highlights the challenges AI developers face in prioritizing truth and transparency. xAI fixed the immediate problem by removing the directive to avoid mentioning Trump and Musk regarding misinformation, but it underscores ongoing tensions. Balancing accuracy, harm prevention, and algorithmic transparency remains challenging.\n\nAs AI integrates into sensitive areas like news, politics, and finance, vigilance and critical thinking are essential. The quest for truth-seeking AI continues, but incidents like the Grok 3 controversy remind us that technology mirrors human values and conflicts. For Musk and xAI, proving a real commitment to truthful AI beyond marketing hype will be crucial, even when the truths might be uncomfortable.\n\nUpdates on the latest developments, trends, and news in the field of information and communication technology",

Powell said,&ldquo;While tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation, it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent.&rdquo;&nbsp;Moments before Powell&rsquo;s speech, US President Donald Trump called out the Fed chair to &ldquo;CUT INTEREST RATES&rdquo; in a post on the Truth Social, taking a jab at Powell for being &ldquo;always late.&rdquo;Source: Truth SocialCurrently, the Fed faces a critical choice: pause interest rate cuts throughout the year or respond quickly with rate reductions if the economy shows signs of weakening. While the Fed official noted that the economy is in a good place, Powell said that it was, &ldquo;Too soon to say what will be the appropriate path for monetary policy,&rdquo;On April 4, the unemployment rate also increased to 4.2% in March from 4.1% in February, but on the contrary, March&rsquo;s Non-Farm Payrolls added 228,000 jobs, which exceeded expectations and reinforced economic strength. In March, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) also rose by 2.8% year over year, with March data due on April 10.

Although Bitcoin hit a 9-day high on April 2 before President Trump rolled out his &ldquo;reciprocal tariffs&rdquo; on &ldquo;Liberation Day,&rdquo; the price sold off sharply once the tariffs were revealed at a White House presser. Since then, Bitcoin has held steady above the $82,000 level, and as US equities markets collapsed on April 4, BTC rallied to $84,720, reflecting price action, which is uncharacteristic of the norm.

However, it experienced notable volatility and a 15% price rise when the trade war escalated in mid-2018, with the US imposing tariffs on Chinese goods in July, followed by retaliatory measures from China.

Although the regulatory stars are aligning, the crypto industry just experienced its worst quarter in years.The prices of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) recorded their worst Q1 in seven years, market sentiment fell to its lowest point since the last bear market, and Coinbase stock experienced its worst sell-off since the FTX debacle.&nbsp;With the first quarter finally in the books, investors are looking forward to positive catalysts for Bitcoin and the broader market. This could come in the form of favorable Spring seasonality, more clarity on Trump&rsquo;s tariff policy and shifting policy winds at the Federal Reserve.&nbsp;Coinbase stock suffers worst quarter since 2022Coinbase stock, which has long been considered an important bellwether for the crypto industry, plunged by 33% in the first quarter despite reporting strong business fundamentals and a solid revenue outlook. As Cointelegraph reported, it was the worst quarterly decline since the FTX exchange collapse in late 2022.Like other crypto-native businesses, Coinbase&rsquo;s performance languished under the pressure of Trump&rsquo;s tariff war, volatile digital asset prices and the overhang of tightening financial conditions from the previous quarter.Beyond these short-term headwinds, though, Coinbase is booming. The company&rsquo;s revenues more than doubled in 2024, reaching $6.6 billion. Its adjusted earnings rose to $3.3 billion, marking two consecutive years of growth.&nbsp;COIN stock&rsquo;s volatile year so far.

The venture is majority-owned by Hut 8, a public crypto miner.&nbsp;American Bitcoin &ldquo;aims to become the world&rsquo;s largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner while building a robust strategic Bitcoin reserve,&rdquo; the announcement said.Although crypto prices are down, it&rsquo;s getting harder for investors to remain bearish on the industry with the Trump family investing so heavily. The family is behind the DeFi project World Liberty Financial, which has amassed a large portfolio of digital assets that include Ether, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Aave (AAVE) and Chainlink (LINK).Tether stacks more BTCStablecoin issuer Tether bolstered its balance sheet in the first quarter by acquiring 8,888 Bitcoin, according to onchain data that was later confirmed by CEO Paolo Ardoino. The company now holds 100,521 BTC valued at roughly $8.7 billion.Tether is able to acquire Bitcoin and expand its venture capital business thanks in large part to its highly profitable stablecoin operations. The company generated $13 billion in profit last year on the back of its massive holdings of interest-bearing US Treasury bonds.&nbsp;Despite its success, Tether has been the subject of negative reports by the media, industry and politicians. A recent JPMorgan report argued that Tether would be forced to sell a portion of its Bitcoin holdings to comply with forthcoming US stablecoin regulations.&nbsp;A company spokesperson threw cold water on the conclusion, telling Cointelegraph that JPMorgan understands &ldquo;neither Bitcoin nor Tether.&rdquo;&nbsp;GameStop raises $1.5B for Bitcoin purchasesVideo game retailer turned meme stock GameStop Corporation is poised to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet after finalizing a $1.5 billion convertible debt offering.&ldquo;The company expects to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin in a manner consistent with the Company's Investment Policy,&rdquo; GameStop said.GameStop&rsquo;s board approved the plan to invest in Bitcoin last month. The approval also green-lighted the company&rsquo;s acquisition of US dollar-denominated stablecoins.&nbsp;In addition to raising debt to buy Bitcoin, GameStop hinted at potentially using a portion of its $4.8 billion cash reserves to fund future acquisitions.&nbsp;GameStop shares have experienced extreme volatility since March 26, when the company first disclosed its plan to acquire BTC.

    "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has no business with certain stablecoins or their issuers, the regulator's staff declared in the latest statement outlining the corners of the crypto sector for which it doesn't have a legal interest.Since the agency was taken over by President Donald Trump-appointed leadership and formed a Crypto Task Force to ease pressures on the digital assets space, its staff has issued a series of statements meant to clarify the crypto areas outside its jurisdiction — so far including memecoins and proof-of-work crypto mining. It's now added certain stablecoins to that list. The SEC's Division of Corporation Finance issued the Friday statement — not yet a binding rule, or even formal guidance — to declare such stablecoins \"do not involve the offer and sale of securities.\"\"Persons involved in the process of 'minting' (or creating) and redeeming Covered Stablecoins do not need to register those transactions with the Commission under the Securities Act or fall within one of the Securities Act’s exemptions from registration,\" according to the statement.It went on to clarify that such stablecoins — an arena dominated by Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC — \"are marketed solely for use in commerce, as a means of making payments, transmitting money, and/or storing value, and not as investments.\"However, the stablecoins covered by this statement may not include Tether's, because one of the footnotes says acceptable reserves \"do not include precious metals or other crypto assets,\" both of which are included in Tether's reserves. And the statement says any tokens must be redeemable at any time for dollars, but Tether's terms of service suggest minimum amounts or delays may be imposed. Circle President Heath Tarbert posted a social-media comment that included a jab toward its competitors. \"The SEC just drew a clear line: Stablecoins backed one-for-one with high quality liquid assets —l ike USDC — are NOT securities,\" Tarbert said. \"This certainty does not extend to other digital assets just because they call themselves 'stablecoins.'\"Congress has been moving forward on establishing a new set of U.S. standards for the issuance of such tokens. This week, the House Financial Services Committee advanced a stablecoin bill toward a vote of the overall House of Representatives. The Senate is building toward consideration of a similar bill that's also been approved by committee there — in both cases by a wide, bipartisan vote.While they're the most sedate of crypto assets, stablecoins have been a colorful political topic in recent weeks, as the Trump-backed World Liberty Financial pitched its own stablecoin, and some congressional Democrats are concerned that Elon Musk will leverage his status as a tech giant to follow suit.SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who is leading the agency's task force, has said she feels the early, nonbinding moves to reverse crypto resistance at the SEC are important and should be done as rapidly as possible, even if they're not yet official policy. She's said non-fungible tokens (NFTS) may also be considered for such a statement.

The Senate Banking Committee approved his nomination in a party-line vote this week.Even before his arrival, interim Chairman Mark Uyeda has made dramatic moves to overhaul the regulator's crypto position. That's included throwing out most of the prominent enforcement cases the agency had pursued against digital assets businesses, though a few remain.UPDATE (April 4, 2025, 20:52 UTC): Adds information on Tether's token being potentially left out.

The failure of the bears to capitalize on the opportunity shows a lack of selling at lower levels.Risky assets were rattled after US President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on several countries on April 2. The fall in the US markets deepened on April 4 after China announced a retaliatory tariff of 34% on all imported US goods starting April 10.While several market participants are concerned about the near-term impact of tariffs, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said he loves tariffs since he expects them to be positive for Bitcoin and gold in the medium term.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360On the more cautious side was market commentator Byzantine General, who said in a post on X that the cryptocurrency market&rsquo;s upside would be limited due to possible tariff responses.&nbsp;Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards said in his analysis that Bitcoin would turn bullish on a break and close above $91,000. If that does not happen, he anticipates Bitcoin to fall to the $71,000 zone.Could Bitcoin outperform by staying above $80,000? Will the altcoins crumble? Let&rsquo;s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price analysisBitcoin rose above the resistance line on April 2, but the long wick on the candlestick shows solid selling at higher levels. The price turned down sharply and broke below the 20-day exponential moving average ($84,483).BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears will have to sink the price below the $80,000 support to strengthen their position. If they do that, the BTC/USDT pair could retest the March 11 low of $76,606. Buyers are expected to defend this level with all their might because a break and close below $76,606 could sink the pair to $73,777 and eventually to $67,000.The crucial resistance to watch out for on the upside is $88,500. A break and close above this level will signal that the corrective phase may be over. The pair could then start its journey toward $95,000.Ether price analysisEther (ETH) has been trading between the $1,754 support and the 20-day EMA ($1,928) for the past few days.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThat increases the likelihood of a break and close below $1,754. If sellers can pull it off, the ETH/USDT pair could start the next leg of the downtrend to $1,550.A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that the relative strength index (RSI) has formed a positive divergence. That suggests the bearish momentum may be weakening. If the price rebounds off $1,754, the pair could face selling at the 20-day EMA. However, if buyers overcome the obstacle, the pair could rally to $2,111. A short-term trend reversal will be signaled on a close above $2,111.XRP price analysisXRP (XRP) bears successfully defended the 20-day EMA ($2.23) on April 2 and pulled the price to the critical support at $2.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI below 44 increase the risk of a break below $2. If that happens, the XRP/USDT pair will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. The pair has support at $1.77, but if the level gets taken out, the decline could extend to $1.27.Buyers have an uphill task ahead of them if they want to prevent the breakdown. They will have to swiftly push the price above the 50-day simple moving average ($2.37) to clear the path for a relief rally to the resistance line.BNB price analysisBNB (BNB) bulls failed to push the price back above the moving averages in the past few days, indicating selling at higher levels.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe moving averages have started to turn down, and the RSI is in the negative zone, signaling a minor advantage for the bears. There is support at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $575 and next at the 61.8% retracement level of $559.On the upside, the bulls will have to push and maintain the price above the 50-day SMA ($614) to signal a comeback. The BNB/USDT pair may rise to $644, which is a critical overhead resistance to watch out for. If buyers overcome the barrier at $644, the pair may travel to $686.Solana price analysisSolana (SOL) rose above the 20-day EMA ($128) on April 2, but the bears sold at higher levels and pulled the price below the $120 support.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory heighten the risk of a break below $110. If that happens, the selling could intensify, and the SOL/USDT pair may plummet to $100 and subsequently to $80.The bulls are unlikely to give up easily and will try to keep the pair inside the $110 to $260 range. Buyers will have to push and maintain the price above $147 to suggest that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair may then ascend to $180.Dogecoin price analysisDogecoin (DOGE) bears thwarted attempts by the bulls to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.17) on April 2.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA positive sign in favor of the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to slide below the $0.16 support. A break above the 20-day EMA could push the price to the 50-day SMA ($0.19). Buyers will have to overcome the 50-day SMA to start a rally to $0.24 and later to $0.29.Alternatively, if the price turns down from the moving averages and breaks below $0.16, it will clear the path for a drop to $0.14. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $0.14 support because a break below it may sink the DOGE/USDT pair to $0.10.Cardano price analysisCardano (ADA) turned down sharply from the 20-day EMA ($0.69) on April 2 and closed below the uptrend line.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls are trying to push the price back above the uptrend line but are likely to face solid selling at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the ADA/USDT pair could descend to $0.58 and then to $0.50.This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up sharply and breaks above the 50-day SMA ($0.74). That opens the doors for a rally to $0.84, which may attract sellers.&nbsp;Related: Altcoins are set for one last big rally, but just a few will benefit &mdash; AnalystToncoin price analysisToncoin&rsquo;s (TON) failure to maintain above the $4.14 resistance on April 1 may have tempted short-term traders to book profits.TON/USDT daily chart.

There is support at $3.32, but if the level cracks, the pair may drop to $2.81.Instead, if the price rebounds off $3.32, the pair could attempt to form a range in the near term. The pair could swing between $3.32 and $4.14 for some time. A break and close above $4.14 will signal that the downtrend may be over. The pair could then jump to $5.UNUS SED LEO price analysisUNUS SED LEO (LEO) bears pulled the price below the uptrend line on March 2 but could not sustain the lower levels. That suggests buying at lower levels.LEO/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($9.57) is turning down gradually, and the RSI is in the negative zone, signaling a slight advantage to the bears. If the price turns down from the moving averages, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the LEO/USD pair below the $8.84 support. If they succeed, the pair may tumble to $8.Contrarily, a break above the moving averages opens the doors for a rise to the overhead resistance of $9.90. If buyers pierce the $9.90 resistance, the pair will complete a bullish ascending triangle pattern. The pair may then climb toward the target objective of $12.04.Chainlink price analysisChainlink (LINK) once again turned down from the 20-day EMA ($13.98) on March 2, indicating that the bears continue selling on rallies.LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe LINK/USDT pair has strong support in the zone between $12 and the support line of the descending channel pattern. A rebound off the support zone will have to rise above the moving averages to signal a stronger recovery toward $17.50.Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will attempt to pull the price below the support line. If they can pull it off, the pair could extend the downtrend toward the crucial support at $10 and, after that, to $8.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "content": "Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2025 with our curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out The Crunchbase Megadeals Board.\n\nThis is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out the biggest funding rounds of last week here.\n\nThis was a week right out of the free-spending days of 2021. Huge rounds were abundant — led by the biggest of them all as OpenAI’s massive $40 billion investment was finally announced.\n\n1. OpenAI, $40B, artificial intelligence: Of course the big news of the week was the $40 billion investment for OpenAI led by SoftBank. The deal is the biggest venture investment ever. Per details of the deal, SoftBank will build a syndicate of co-investors to provide $10 billion of the total, while it expects to fund the other $30 billion, with  $10 billion of that through debt. The deal also is partially contingent upon conditions of OpenAI’s restructuring of its for-profit subsidiary. If that occurs, OpenAI will have a post-money valuation of $300 billion.\n\n2. Plaid, $575M, fintech: Plaid raised a massive $575 million round led by Franklin Templeton at a $6.1 billion valuation. The San Francisco-based company plans to use the cash to pay employee tax withholding obligations related to share conversion and to offer some liquidity to employees via a tender offer. Plaid, which connects user bank accounts to fintech apps, had a planned $5.3 billion sale to Visa scrapped back in 2021 following regulatory issues.\n\n3. Silicon Ranch, $500M, energy: Nashville, Tennessee-based Silicon Ranch raised $500 million from European infrastructure investor AIP Management. The big investment is likely a bet on the U.S.’ increasing electricity demands. Silicon Ranch — which operates solar and battery projects — has been on this list before. Back in 2022, the company raised $775 million in equity capital led by Manulife Investment Management. Founded in 2011, the energy company has raised more than $2 billion, according to Crunchbase data.\n\n4. Runway, $308M, artificial intelligence: New York-based Runway raised $308 million in a new round at about double its valuation from less than two years ago. The new round — led by General Atlantic — values the AI video startup at more than $3 billion, per reports. In June 2023, the company raised a $141 million extension to its December 2022 $50 million Series C. Runway makes software that lets users create videos using text prompts or images. Earlier in the week, Runway unveiled its new AI model, Gen-4, that allows users to create videos with consistent characters and backgrounds. Last fall, the company signed a deal with production company LionsGate to create a customized video-generation model. The startup plans to use the fresh cash to develop AI focusing on its film and animation studio. Founded in 2018, it has raised more than $540 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n5. AIRNA, $155M, biotech: Cambridge, Massachusetts-based AIRNA, a biotech startup developing RNA editing therapeutics to help with both rare and common conditions, closed a $155 million Series B led by Forbion Capital Partners and Venrock Healthcare Capital Partners. The new cash will go toward launching a phase trial for AIRNA’s drug candidate for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and help it develop its pipeline of RNA editing therapeutics. Founded in 2021, the company has raised $245 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n6. (tied) Atsena Therapeutics, $150M, biotech: Atsena Therapeutics, a gene therapy company focused on reversing or preventing blindness, closed a $150 million Series C led by Bain Capital’s Life Sciences arm. The money from the financing will be used to advance the Durham, North Carolina-based company’s treatment of X-linked retinoschisis, a genetic condition that is typically diagnosed in childhood and leads to blindness later in life. The proceeds will also support Atsena’s preclinical pipeline. Founded in 2019, the company has raised nearly $238 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n6. (tied) SandboxAQ, $150M, quantum computing: Alphabet spinoff SandboxAQ — an AI and quantum computing startup — added another $150 million to its Series E from the likes Google and Nvidia. The add-on comes less than four months after the company announced it had raised a $300 million round at a $5.6 billion valuation. SandboxAQ is looking at the related effects of both AI and quantum — which is where the company gets “AQ” — to develop commercial products for telecom, financial services, health care, security and other computationally intensive sectors. The company already is working with a handful of customers on enterprise software and cybersecurity tools related to quantum computing. In March 2022, Alphabet officially spun off its 6-year-old quantum tech group — SandboxAQ — which emerged as its own company after closing a $500 million financing round and naming former Google CEO Eric Schmidt chairman. SandboxAQ has raised over $950 million, per the company.\n\n8. Temporal Technologies, $146M, software: Seattle-based Temporal Technologies locked up a big $146 million Series C at a $1.7 billion valuation led by Tiger Global Management. The company helps other companies manage complex software applications and will use the new cash to develop cloud products and invest in research and development for artificial intelligence use. The company raised a $103 million Series B in February 2022 at a valuation of a little more than $1.5 billion, followed by $75 million in a Series “B-Prime.” Founded in 2019, Temporal has raised $350 million, per the company.\n\n9. RayThera, $110M, biotech: San Diego-based RayThera, a biotechnology company currently focused on developing small molecule therapies in immunology, completed a $110 million Series A financing co-led by Foresite Capital and OrbiMed. This is the company’s first raise, per Crunchbase.\n\n10. Neurona Therapeutics, $102M, biotech: Neurona Therapeutics, a South San Francisco-based clinical-stage biotech company developing regenerative cell therapies for disorders of the nervous system, raised a $102 million financing round. Investors included Fidelity Management & Research Co. Founded in 2008, the company has raised $426 million, per Crunchbase.\nBig global deals\n\nThe biggest raise this week came from across the pond.\n\nGoogle spinoff Isomorphic Labs raised $600 million in its first external funding round as the company looks to apply artificial intelligence to the drug development process. The new round was led by Thrive Capital with participation from Google Ventures. The London-based AI company will receive follow-on capital from existing investor Alphabet.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of March 29 to April 4. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

After years of false starts and regulatory hangups, the stablecoin issuer finally filed its S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, taking a long-delayed step toward becoming a publicly traded company.The filing landed with a mix of energy and doubt. Some in the industry saw it as a bullish signal—another crypto heavyweight inching closer to the public markets. Others questioned the timing. Markets remain shaky, and Circle’s path to a successful debut is far from guaranteed.\"I believe Circle will be able to price their IPO and raise capital, however it isn't going to be easy,” said David Pakman, managing partner and head of venture investments at CoinFund. “Generally, companies going public would like to debut during strong equity markets.”Equities have been in a free fall since Trump announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on about 90 U.S. trade partners, including China and the European Union, deepening fears of a global recession. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have dipped 11% and 17% year-to-date, respectively, marking one of the worst quarters in recent years.As a result, cloud computing firm CloudWeave, which went public last month, saw a disappointing debut, even though the stock rebounded on the second day of trading as investor demand for artificial intelligence companies appears to be stronger than short-term anxiety in markets. Payments app Klarna said it paused its IPO plan earlier today.But Circle doesn’t just face broader market jitters as a potential threat to its IPO. Analysts have pointed out the company’s financials, which could make it difficult to attract investors.“While I personally have tremendous respect and appreciation for Circle and their leadership, their financials show the challenges they have faced with growth and the high cost of their distribution partnerships,” Pakman, who noted that he still believes long-term value of the company, said.Circle’s IPO filing revealed shrinking gross margins and high spending, which comes at a time when clearer stablecoin regulation could bring increased competition to the market.“Circle is currently being priced like a traditional crypto business — cyclical, interest rate-dependent, and not diversified enough. If Circle can evolve to look more like a payments network with high margins and strong moats, its valuation might reflect that,” Lorenzo Valente, a crypto analyst at ARK Invest, wrote in a post on X.Many aspects about the company’s structure seem to be in question, including how its revenue-sharing agreement will evolve, as well as the growth of Base, the blockchain created by Coinbase that uses Circle’s USDC, according to Valente.“One precaution Circle has taken is a lower valuation. But, still hurdles remain as the rollout and implementation of digital rails in the banking system will take time,” said Mark Connors, chief investment strategist at Risk Dimensions, a New York-based Bitcoin investment advisory.Circle’s rumored valuation of $4 billion to $6 billion, roughly 13 to 20 times its adjusted EBITDA, is in line with Coinbase and Block, and “not necessarily cheap, especially considering its recent drop in profitability,” Valente said.“We do like the prospect for the growth in US-backed stablecoins based on the growing commercial use, shift in U.S. the regulatory and legislative (GENIUS Act) winds and the U.S. Treasury’s incentive to find new buyers of its growing stack of U.S. T-Bills,” according to Connors.Over $6 trillion of Treasury bills will be rolled over this year, with additional issuance likely to fund the still-growing U.S. deficit.Despite market uncertainty about the remaining year, several other crypto natives are looking to fulfill their IPO dreams, including Kraken, Gemini, Blockchain.com, Bullish (the parent company of CoinDesk) and BitGo. Even more crypto firms are rumored to be in talks to go public as well.However, others will likely put their IPO plans on hold as they wait for regulatory clarity and better market conditions. Analysts at crypto M&A advisory firm Architect Partners expect the majority of IPOs to be filed in the second half of 2025 after written regulations and policies are clearly completed.",

The introduction of slashing will mark the first \"feature complete\" version of the protocol.EigenLayer pioneered the concept of restaking, a way for Ethereum users to secure additional protocols beyond the base layer by recommitting their staked Ether. Slashing was supposed to be a core part of this system, providing apps a way to punish bad actors by seizing a portion of their capital.The implementation of slashing will allow Actively Validated Services (AVSs) — apps built atop EigenLayer's restaking system — to set custom conditions penalizing operators who fail to meet pre-established conditions and rewarding those who do.\"This is a major step forward in the EigenLayer protocol because it allows for a free marketplace where Operators can earn rewards for their work and AVSs can launch verifiable services,\" EigenLayer said in a blog post.EigenLayer attracted more than $15 billion to the platform within a year and generated massive hype for the EIGEN token, which launched in October.EigenLayer’s ecosystem has been expanding, with \"100+\" AVSs in development, according to its website. Notable services include EigenDA, a data availability service operated by Eigen Labs, and ARPA Network, which specializes in trustless randomization.While EigenLayer pioneered restaking, the lack of slashing left room for competitors to gain market share. Symbiotic, which allows for the restaking of any asset, has been used by EigenLayer early adopters including Hyperlane, an interoperability framework, and Ethena, a popular synthetic dollar protocol.Read more: EigenLayer, Crypto's Biggest Project Launch This Year, Is Still Missing Crucial Functionality",

The impact of tariffs on crypto is much debated by researchers. Meanwhile, the digital assets industry prepared for better days ahead.

    "content": "Bitcoin's original promise of \"peer-to-peer electronic cash\" hasn't exactly developed in the way Satoshi intended. More people than ever are eager to pay in crypto, while most vendors want nothing but fiat.While the mismatch has plenty of workarounds in countries with a strong banking and credit card culture, it's a real problem in places with alternative electronic payment rails, like QR codes, says pseudonymous crypto developer Sheldon Cooper. How can one scan a fiat-only code and pay in stablecoins?Cooper's claimed solution, P2P.me, does it without ever touching the regular on-and-off ramps. Instead, this blockchain-based service relies on a network of middlemen willing to accept USDC from, say, Alice and send the equivalent fiat along to Bob. The whole process takes about 90 seconds, he said.There are no traditional identity checks, either. P2P.me vets its users with zero-knowledge proofs that checks for a real-seeming social media presence and maybe even for a government ID. But it doesn't store this personal data as would most financial institutions from banks on down to Binance.\"What we thought about is, 'How do we decentralize this? How do we do on and off rams in a decentralized way,'\" said Cooper. \"The number one concern is privacy and self custody. All these CEXes give data to the government.\"P2P.me's quirky blend of permissionless markets and privacy tech has processed $1.6 million in payments from around 1,100 users, mostly in Indonesia, Nigeria and Vietnam. That modest amount, quickly growing, was enough to get venture capitalists' interest: Multicoin Capital and Coinbase Ventures recently invested $2 million P2P.me's seed round.The money's already helped P2P.me scale its team to 20 people ahead of a planned push into Latin America, Cooper said. He sees local communities that struggle to navigate established financial rails as key adopters. So too are crypto-savvy tourists who go places where their credit cards don't work, but their cell phones do.Built on Base, the open protocol plans to launch a token in the next 12 months that will shift control to the community, according to Cooper.\"The strategic idea of the token is to scale globally, to break the network effects of the centralized exchange with P2P,\" he said.",

Gold is usually seen as a haven investment, but large-scale losses in equity markets often force investors to liquidate safer assets to cover margin calls and cash out losses.PAXG climbed to an all-time high of $3,191 with XAUT following closely behind to reach $3,190, exceeding spot gold’s peak of $3,167. The initial rise didn’t last, with PAXG dropping to $3,074 and XAUT to $3,064, mirroring gold's pullback to $3,038 per ounce.The tariffs announced on Wednesday spooked markets with their breadth and unclear targets. Investors, already jittery from a volatile global outlook, responded swiftly.

    "content": "In the early-1990s, telephone companies ran ads for long distance calls highlighting the cost per minute for a U.S. customer to speak to someone in another country. Today, that business does not exist. You can now Facetime or Zoom anyone, anywhere, for free.What changed?The shift to Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) ultimately drove the price of calls down to nearly zero.Today, we are experiencing a similar transformation as a global, embedded financial layer emerges within the internet. This will ultimately drive money transfer costs closer to zero, transforming a system long burdened by high fees, delays and middlemen.Stablecoins are the application driving this evolution. The maxim “adoption is slow until it is fast” captures their explosive growth in recent years. To get an idea of scale, stablecoin transaction volume surged above $27 trillion in 2024 – surpassing Visa and Mastercard combined. Today, there are stablecoin providers, such as Tether, that hold more U.S. Treasuries than entire countries like Germany and the Netherlands.Stablecoins are no longer a niche experiment. They are becoming more deeply embedded in our global financial ecosystem. As U.S. lawmakers debate stablecoin legislation, the goal should be clear: reinforce the dollar’s dominance as the global reserve currency while extending its reach into corners of the world that traditional banking cannot touch. This should include many important players — not just those based in the United States.Two Paths, One FutureCongress is at a crossroads between two general positions. One is a closed-market approach in which U.S.-based stablecoin issuers would be privileged over their non-U.S. competitors. This is shortsighted and will ultimately stifle innovation.The other approach is to build a regulatory framework that cultivates fair and free global competition. By allowing international players like Tether to compete alongside U.S.-based issuers, the U.S. can foster a dynamic ecosystem where the best ideas and technologies rise to the top. Competition is what would drive excellence.There is a myth being perpetrated that only U.S.-based issuers back their tokens with sufficient reserves, attest to those reserves, and take necessary steps to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. That simply is not true. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, assisted American law enforcement and over 230 law enforcement agencies in 50 countries to block $2.5 billion dollars in illicit activities worldwide. The reality is that responsible stablecoin issuers exist both inside and outside the U.S. (Tether, which is based in El Salvador, accounts for more than half the stablecoin market.)Overly restrictive regulation could also backfire on the U.S. economy. If stablecoin legislation drives foreign-based companies out of the U.S., it could result in decreased demand for U.S. Treasuries, weakened dollar dominance and a less competitive stablecoin space.Congress stands at an important crossroads — “two roads diverged” as Robert Frost once wrote. It could seize this moment to craft a regulatory framework that champions competition and transparency, or it could take the narrow road by taking a protectionist approach and choking innovation. The market’s diversity is not a bug to fix. It’s a feature to harness.It's time to make a careful choice as the stakes could not be higher. Let's make sure we get this right for the future of finance.",

    "title": "The future of DeFi isn’t on Ethereum — it’s on Bitcoin",
    "content": "Opinion by: Matt Mudano, CEO of Arch Labs&nbsp;Ethereum is struggling, and decentralized finance (DeFi) is suffering as a result. Layer-2 (L2) solutions have fractured liquidity, making capital inefficient. In search of greener pastures, the community has turned to Solana &mdash; only to find a memecoin-driven ecosystem fueled by pump-and-dump schemes, attracting liquidity extractors, and turning the chain into a playground for speculation and fraud.DeFi needs a reset that returns to first principles and aligns with Satoshi&rsquo;s original vision of a decentralized financial system. The only network capable of sustaining the next evolution of DeFi isn&rsquo;t Ethereum or Solana. It&rsquo;s Bitcoin.DeFi is struggling on Ethereum&nbsp;Ethereum was once the undisputed home of DeFi, but today, it&rsquo;s clear that the ecosystem is struggling. The network&rsquo;s roadmap constantly changes, with no clear path toward long-term sustainability.L2 solutions were supposed to scale Ethereum. Instead, they&rsquo;ve fractured DeFi into isolated liquidity silos. While L2s have lowered transaction fees, they now compete for liquidity rather than contributing to a unified financial system. The result? A fragmented landscape that makes capital inefficient and DeFi protocols harder to scale.Ethereum&rsquo;s proposed solution &mdash; chain abstraction &mdash; sounds promising in theory but fails in practice. The fundamental issue is a structural misalignment of incentives, and as a result, Ethereum is gradually losing its competitive edge in DeFi.It&rsquo;s time to ask: Can DeFi&rsquo;s future lie in a fragmented Ethereum?Solana isn&rsquo;t the answerWith Ethereum losing its competitive edge, many developers and users have turned to Solana. The blockchain has seen an 83% increase in developer activity year-over-year, and its decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have outperformed Ethereum&rsquo;s for five consecutive months.&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a fundamental problem: Solana&rsquo;s DeFi growth isn&rsquo;t built on sustainable financial applications &mdash; a memecoin frenzy fuels it.The recent surge in activity isn&rsquo;t driven by innovation in decentralized finance but by speculative trades. Following the TRUMP memecoin craze, the total extracted value from Solana&rsquo;s memecoins ranged between $3.6 billion and $6.6 billion. This isn&rsquo;t DeFi growth &mdash; it&rsquo;s a liquidity extraction engine where short-term speculators cash in and move on.Solana has real strengths. Its speed and low transaction costs make it ideal for high-frequency trading, and its ecosystem has made meaningful strides in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs), AI and decentralized science, or DeSci. But the dominance of memecoin speculation has turned the chain into a playground for fraud and pump-and-dump schemes. That&rsquo;s not the foundation DeFi needs.Solana isn&rsquo;t the answer if the goal is to build a lasting financial system.Bitcoin DeFi is thrivingIt&rsquo;s time to return to first principles and build DeFi on the original blockchain: Bitcoin &mdash; the most trusted, decentralized network backed by the soundest money in the digital economy.This is not just theoretical. Bitcoin DeFi is already experiencing explosive growth. Consider the numbers: Total value locked (TVL) in Bitcoin DeFi surged from $300 million in early 2024 to $5.4 billion as of Feb. 28, 2025 &mdash; a staggering 1,700% increase. The Bitcoin staking sector is dominating, with protocols like Babylon ($4.68 billion TVL), Lombard ($1.59 billion) and SolvBTC ($715 million) leading the charge. This demonstrates the growing demand for Bitcoin to become a productive asset rather than a passive store of value.Recent: Bitcoin DeFi takes center stageBitcoin-native DeFi isn&rsquo;t simply copying Ethereum&rsquo;s playbook &mdash; it&rsquo;s pioneering new financial models. Advancements in the space have introduced dual staking, allowing users to stake Bitcoin (BTC) alongside native tokens to enhance security and earn yields. Meanwhile, novel approaches to tokenizing Bitcoin&rsquo;s hashrate turn mining power into collateral for lending, borrowing and staking, further expanding Bitcoin&rsquo;s financial utility.In addition, Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens have driven record-high transaction activity, with inscriptions reaching 66.7 million and generating $420 million in fees &mdash; highlighting the growing demand for tokenized assets on Bitcoin.It is clear that Bitcoin is no longer just digital gold &mdash; it&rsquo;s becoming the foundation for the next phase of decentralized finance.The future of DeFi is on BitcoinThe future of DeFi lies with Bitcoin, where incentives align with long-term value creation. Unlike Ethereum&rsquo;s fragmented model and Solana&rsquo;s speculative economy, Bitcoin-based DeFi is built on institutional-grade liquidity and sustainable growth.As the largest and most liquid crypto asset, Bitcoin boasts a $1.7 trillion market cap and $94 billion in exchange-traded fund (ETF) holdings. Even a fraction of this liquidity migrating into DeFi would be a game-changer. Bitcoin holds over $1 trillion in untapped liquidity and continues to attract strong interest from institutional investors and sovereign wealth funds, with governments already exploring it as a potential reserve asset.Several projects are already building on Bitcoin, building a sustainable ecosystem where users can hold the most trusted digital asset while making it productive through DeFi mechanisms.&nbsp;Ethereum had its moment. Solana had its hype.

    "content": "Riot Platforms (RIOT) reported strong operational performance in March 2025, highlighted by continued expansion into the artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) sector. The company's bitcoin (BTC) production last month rose to 533 BTC, the most since the reward halving almost a year ago. The figure represents a month-on-month increase of 13% and 25% more than a year before. Bitcoin holdings grew to 19,223 BTC.Riot said it plans to \"aggressively pursue\" development of its Corsicana facility to capitalize on rising demand for compute infrastructure used in AI and HPC. A recently completed feasibility study by industry consultant Altman Solon confirmed the significant potential of the site to support up to 600 megawatts of additional capacity for AI/HPC applications. Key advantages include 1.0 gigawatt of secured power, 400 MW of which is already operational, 265 acres of land with substantial development potential and close proximity to Dallas — a major hub for AI and cloud computing. The study noted the site’s ability to support both inference and cloud-based workloads, strengthening its appeal to AI/HPC tenants. Riot maintained a steady deployed hash rate of 33.7 EH/s, while its average operating hash rate grew 3% month-over-month to 30.3 EH/s—representing a 254% increase year-over-year. Although power credits declined due to seasonal factors, Riot kept its all-in power cost low at 3.8 cents per kWh, and improved fleet efficiency to 21.0 J/TH, a 22% improvement from the previous year. Riot’s shares fell 5.5% Friday, while the Nasdaq 100 index dropped 2.8%. They have lost 35% year-to-date.Disclaimer: This article was generated with AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "title": "A Blueprint for Digital Assets in America",
    "content": "In 2008, an anonymous person or group of people known only as “Satoshi Nakamoto” released a now-seminal document, the Bitcoin White paper, introducing a peer-to-peer system for value of exchange without intermediaries.With this revolutionary concept, the idea of a “digital asset” was born. Soon after, developers and entrepreneurs expanded on this concept, developing systems where value was exchanged not just for its own sake, but for services and digital products.Over the past decade, innovators have built permissionless, decentralized networks for computing services, file storage, asset exchange, cellular coverage, Wi-Fi connectivity, mapping tools, lending services, and more. Because digital assets can be used for services that anyone can offer and anyone can access, the use-cases – both financial and non-financial – are potentially endless.Despite this promise, these networks have courted criticism. The Biden-Harris Administration attempted to block this innovative advance through a relentless campaign of lawsuits and enforcement actions without providing the regulatory clarity the digital asset ecosystem and its innovators and users so desperately needed.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) failed to clarify how existing securities laws apply and — more importantly — don’t apply to digital asset transactions. This lack of regulatory clarity stifled the digital asset ecosystem, pushing growth out of the United States to jurisdictions that have established clear rules of the road.To address these failures, Congress began exploring ways to modernize the regulatory structure to accommodate the unique characteristics of digital assets and how they could be used in our financial system. These efforts culminated in a series of bills aimed at clarifying how digital assets could be used in the financial system, ensuring investor protection and fostering innovation.In the 118th Congress, the House Committees on Financial Services and Agriculture launched a historic joint effort to address digital asset regulation. This led to the first-ever passage of bipartisan digital asset market structure legislation in a chamber of Congress. This collaboration enabled Congress to address longstanding challenges in the ecosystem and lay the foundation for a fit for purpose framework under the leadership of President Trump.This Congress, both the House and Senate are committed to creating a clear path forward for the digital asset ecosystem. As we move ahead, it is crucial that the framework is both balanced and iron-clad for the future. To accomplish this, we have set out principles for digital asset legislation.Six principlesFirst, legislation must promote innovation. We seek to protect opportunities for innovators to create and utilize digital assets, while ensuring users can lawfully transact with one another.Second, legislation must provide clarity for the classification of assets. Users of digital assets should clearly understand the nature of their holdings, including whether they qualify as securities or non-securities.Third, legislation must codify a framework for the issuance of new digital assets. The framework should permit issuers to raise capital through the sale of new digital assets under the jurisdiction of the SEC. It should protect retail investors and require developers to disclose relevant information to help users understand the unique characteristics of digital asset networks.Fourth, the legislation must establish the regulation of spot market exchanges and intermediaries. Centralized, custodial exchanges and intermediaries facilitating transactions with non-security digital assets should adhere to similar requirements as other financial firms.Congress should provide the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with the authority to impose requirements over these entities necessary to protect customers, limit conflicts of interest, ensure appropriate execution of customer orders, and provide disclosures.Fifth, the legislation must establish best practices for the protection of customer assets. Entities registered with the SEC or CFTC should be required to segregate customer funds and hold them with qualified custodians. Customer funds should also be protected during bankruptcy.Sixth, and finally, the legislation must protect innovative decentralized projects and activities. Congress should ensure that decentralized protocols, which pose different risks and benefits, are not subject to regulations designed for centralized, custodial firms. In safeguarding decentralized activities, Congress must also protect an individual’s right to self-custody their digital assets.We look forward to both Committees continuing our legislative work together to fulfill President Trump’s request to make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” In May, our Committees will host our second joint hearing to discuss digital asset market structure legislation.Our goal is to bring much-needed regulatory clarity to this rapidly evolving industry, ensuring that America continues to lead in shaping the future of digital finance.",

    "content": "Earlier this week, Bitcoin mining giant Hut 8 revealed a partnership that includes two members of the Trump family &mdash; Donald Jr. and Eric &mdash; and its plans to launch a new mining venture, American Bitcoin.&nbsp;In an exclusive interview on Decentralize with Cointelegraph&rsquo;s Byte-Sized Insight series, Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot shared new details about the venture&rsquo;s vision, why the timing was right and how the company plans to scale.The right team and the right time&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve thought about splitting out our Bitcoin mining and energy infrastructure businesses for some time,&rdquo; Genoot said. &ldquo;Meeting Eric and Don Jr., and seeing their deep passion for Bitcoin and infrastructure, was the perfect catalyst.&rdquo;According to Genoot, the goal is clear: to build one of the world&rsquo;s largest and most efficient Bitcoin mining platforms, rooted in American soil and aligned with pro-Bitcoin sentiment growing under President Donald Trump&rsquo;s administration. &ldquo;Eric told me, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get involved in anything that isn&rsquo;t the biggest and the best,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said.The move comes at a pivotal moment for US-based mining. With China out of the picture post-2021 crackdown, and Washington now openly exploring the idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, America&rsquo;s place in the global mining ecosystem is under transformation.Still, size isn&rsquo;t everything. Genoot emphasized that efficiency and cost-effectiveness are core to the strategy.&nbsp;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to just be the biggest. We want to be the most efficient and cost-effective miner. If our cost basis isn&rsquo;t low, we might as well just buy Bitcoin.&rdquo;Related: Bitcoin miner Hut 8 argues to toss &lsquo;short and distort&rsquo; shareholder suitMining and accumulating BTCAmerican Bitcoin&rsquo;s structure allows it to mine BTC at low cost, accumulate more when the market allows, and potentially expand into other Bitcoin ecosystem services. Hut 8 currently holds over 10,000 BTC on its balance sheet, worth up to $1 billion depending on market conditions. American Bitcoin aims to surpass that.And the company isn&rsquo;t just bullish on Bitcoin; it&rsquo;s bullish on power consumption. Genoot pushed back on criticism that mining wastes energy:&nbsp;&ldquo;Power consumption has only increased with every tech revolution. Cheap, excess energy is what drives Bitcoin mining &mdash; and a lot of that energy is renewable.&rdquo;Looking ahead, Hut 8&rsquo;s mining spinoff has big ambitions. &ldquo;Our focus is scaling. Our focus is taking this company public on a US exchange,&rdquo; Genoot said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear more from us soon.&rdquo;Listen to the full episode of Byte-Sized Insight for the complete interview on Cointelegraph&rsquo;s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

Whether it’s for healthcare, banking, shipping, or school records, current systems often leave data exposed, and with smart devices and AI popping up everywhere, those flaws are getting tougher to fix, the Foundation said.“From healthcare and financial services to supply chains and academics, identity verification serves as the cornerstone of trust,” Thomas A. Mayfield, head of Decentralized Trust and Identity Solutions at Cardano Foundation, wrote in the release. “Despite this, existing solutions often fail to provide adequate security and credential control, resulting in frequent data breaches. Last year alone, 1.7 billion records were compromised in the United States.”Veridian tackles this by letting users take control instead of handing their information to a central authority. It uses open, shared tools to ensure legitimate communication and check identities without a go-between.There’s even an option to link it to the Cardano blockchain for added assurance. The Veridian Wallet ties it all together, letting people manage their details safely from their phones.The wallet application is built for individuals and businesses alike, with options for companies to tweak it for their needs.Read more: Cardano: Deep Dive on the Trump Reserve Token Whose Blockchain Ignores TVL",

    "title": "Has Michael Saylor’s Strategy built a house of cards?",
    "content": "Strategy Inc, formerly MicroStrategy, has discarded its core product, assumed a new identity, swallowed over half a million Bitcoin, spawned equity classes with double-digit yields, and inspired an arsenal of leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs) &mdash; a unique and significant market phenomenon.Michael Saylor&rsquo;s firm has constructed a comprehensive financial framework based around Bitcoin (BTC), tying its corporate performance directly to the cryptocurrency&rsquo;s price fluctuations. As a result, Strategy&rsquo;s common stock has evolved into a proxy for Bitcoin exposure, its preferred shares offer yields tied to cryptocurrency risk, and a series of leveraged and inverse ETFs now track its equity movements, all fundamentally connected to its substantial Bitcoin holdings.Recently, there was an announcement of another purchase by MSTR (Strategy&rsquo;s common equity) of close to $2 billion of BTC in one clip, inviting even more raised eyebrows and caution.This concern is not merely because of Strategy&rsquo;s bet on Bitcoin but the market architecture that has grown around it. A parallel financial ecosystem has emerged, binding its fate to a risk asset that, as Saylor himself notes, trades 24/7. He&rsquo;s championed the idea that &ldquo;volatility is vitality,&rdquo; suggesting that this constant motion draws attention, sustains interest, and breathes life into the entire &ldquo;Strategyverse&rdquo; and its related equities.To some, this is financial innovation in its purest form: bold, unhedged and transformative. To others, it is a fragile lattice of conviction and leverage, one black swan away from unraveling.From MicroStrategy to Strategy: A pivot into the abyss or the vanguard?MicroStrategy, once a staid business intelligence software provider, has been reborn as Strategy Inc, a corporate avatar synonymous with Bitcoin. The company has made an unabashed leap from offering data analytics to becoming a full-throttle Bitcoin acquisition vehicle.The numbers speak for themselves. As of March 30, Strategy holds 528,185 BTC, acquired for approximately $35.63 billion at an average price of about $67,458 per Bitcoin. The most recent tranche of BTC in 2025 involved the acquisition of 22,048 BTC for around $1.92 billion, at an average of roughly $86,969 per coin. Year-to-date, Strategy has achieved a BTC yield of 11.0%.This shift has transformed MSTR into a proxy Bitcoin ETF of sorts, albeit with operational leverage and corporate risk baked in. But unlike the US Securities and Exchange Commission-blessed spot ETFs, MSTR offers amplified exposure: It behaves like Bitcoin, only more so due to the company&rsquo;s use of leverage and financial engineering.Read more: MicroStrategy&rsquo;s Bitcoin debt loop: Stroke of genius or risky gamble?Now, with the introduction of STRK (8% yield) and STRF (10% yield), Strategy has expanded its reach. These preferred shares offer fixed-income-style returns, but their performance is deeply tethered to Bitcoin&rsquo;s fate. When Bitcoin surges, yield-bearing holders cheer. They&rsquo;re still promised yield when it falls, but their capital risk climbs.Financial innovation? Yes. Structural risk? Most certainly.Market performance of Strategy-adjacent equities (Base = 100). Source: TradingViewWhen indexed to 100 at the start of 2025, the performance of Strategy and related instruments demonstrates the effects of volatility and leverage in the Bitcoin-correlated financial ecosystem. As of early April 2025, MSTR has declined moderately by approximately 8%, tracking the broader downward trajectory of Bitcoin itself, which is down around 16%.The company&rsquo;s preferred shares, STRF and STRK, have slightly appreciated above their initial indexed values, reflecting investor preference for dividend stability amid market volatility.MSTU and MSTX have markedly underperformed, dropping around 37%&ndash;38% from their normalized starting points due to volatility drag and compounding losses inherent in leveraged daily reset structures.This YTD snapshot underscores how leverage magnifies returns and the potential risks associated with short-term market movements.Inside the Strategyverse: Bitcoin as treasury, equity as exposureStrategy&rsquo;s operating income, still derived from its legacy software business, now plays second fiddle to its crypto balance sheet.However, the firm hasn&rsquo;t just stockpiled coins; it has created a latticework of financial instruments that reflect and refract BTC price action. MSTR is no longer merely equity; it has become a high-beta Bitcoin play. STRK and STRF are yield-bearing hybrids, offering fixed returns yet functioning like risk instruments in a crypto-linked treasury experiment.The structural concern is this: By tying every new yield product, equity issuance and debt vehicle to Bitcoin, Strategy has effectively replaced diversification with correlation. Critics argue there is no hedge here, only degrees of bullishness.This raises the concern that a company can maintain corporate solvency and investor trust when its financial ecosystem is built atop the volatility of a single, historically unstable asset.Leveraged and inverse productsWhere there is heat, there will be leverage. The market has responded to Strategy&rsquo;s gravitational pull by creating a suite of leveraged and inverse products tied to MSTR, giving retail and institutional players access to turbocharged Bitcoin exposure without holding the asset directly.Investors seeking amplified returns in anticipation of price gains can deploy strategies such as MSTU (T Rex) or MSTX (Defiance), both offering 2x long daily returns, or MST3.L, which provides 3x long exposure listed in London.Conversely, investors expecting price declines might choose SMST, offering 2x short exposure, or MSTS.L and 3SMI, each providing 3x short exposure listed in London.These instruments are typically employed by traders looking for short-term directional bets and should be handled cautiously due to daily reset mechanics and volatility risks.These are not traditional ETFs. They are complex, synthetic instruments with daily reset mechanisms and inherent decay risks. Volatility drag ensures that even in a sideways market, leveraged longs underperform. For shorts, the risk of a short squeeze, particularly in parabolic bull runs, is ever-present.Related: Trade war puts Bitcoin&rsquo;s status as safe-haven asset in doubtIn practical terms, these products allow traders to speculate on MSTR&rsquo;s price with minimal capital outlay. But they also amplify misalignment. A trader betting on Bitcoin&rsquo;s month-long trend might find that their 3x long MSTR ETF underperforms expectations due to compounding losses on down days.The strategic risk here lies in mismatch: Retail investors may perceive these ETFs as direct Bitcoin exposure with leverage. In reality, they are trading a proxy of a proxy, subject to corporate news, dilution and macro shifts.Exposure at different levels of the Strategyverse. Source: Dr. Michael TaboneIs Strategy&rsquo;s strategy conviction or leverage risk?Between 2020 and 2025, Strategy has executed over a dozen capital raises via convertible notes, ATM equity programs and, most recently, the STRF preferred offering priced at a 10% yield. The March 2025 raise helped fund the latest $1.92-billion Bitcoin buy.It is not just about buying Bitcoin. It is about the market constructing a meta-structure where every market instrument, common stock, preferred shares and synthetic ETFs feeds into the same gravitational pull. Each capital raise buys more Bitcoin. Each purchase pushes up sentiment. Each ETF amplifies exposure. This feedback loop has become the hallmark of Strategy&rsquo;s financial architecture.With each new issuance, however, dilution risk grows. STRK and STRF investors depend not only on Strategy&rsquo;s solvency but also on Bitcoin&rsquo;s long-term appreciation. If BTC stumbles into a prolonged bear market, can those 10% yields continue?&nbsp;For investors, Strategy&rsquo;s approach presents clear opportunities and risks. It offers a streamlined pathway for gaining exposure to Bitcoin through familiar financial instruments, combining elements of equity, fixed income and derivatives. At the same time, investors must carefully consider the volatility of Bitcoin itself, the potential impacts of dilution from continuous capital raises, and the overall health of Strategy&rsquo;s balance sheet.Ultimately, the investment outcome will heavily depend on the trajectory of cryptocurrency markets, Strategy&rsquo;s financial management and evolving regulatory landscapes.Magazine: Financial nihilism in crypto is over &mdash; It&rsquo;s time to dream big again",

    "content": "The U.S. employment situation continued to roll along in strong fashion in March, adding another piece to the puzzle as the Federal Reserve contemplates the path of short-term interest rates in a world that's markedly changed in the last 48 hours.Nonfarm payrolls rose by 228,000 last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday morning. Economists had expected a gain of just 135,000 following February’s increase of 117,000 jobs (revised from an originally reported 151,000).The unemployment rate for March, however, rose a tick to 4.2% against economist consensus of 4.1% and February's 4.1%.The price of bitcoin (BTC) was little-changed in the minutes following the report at $82,600.Ahead of the jobs report, the CME FedWatch Tool — which gauges market expectations for Federal Reserve policy — had priced in four rate cuts for 2025, which would bring the federal funds rate down to a target range of 3.25%–3.50%. While the Fed is still expected to hold rates steady at its May meeting, market participants are increasingly betting on a cut in June, with current odds showing a 60% probability.All this comes, of course, as Trump's Wednesday evening tariff announcements threw markets into an historic tizzy. The Nasdaq plunged 6% on Thursday and the S&P 500 just shy of 5%. Hopes for some sort of Friday bounce were dashed a few hours ago when China announced retaliatory tariffs. Prior to the jobs data, Nasdaq and S&P futures were pointing to opening declines of around 3%.Bitcoin added to list of safe havens?To no surprise, gold is among the assets where investors have been hiding out. Though it's down a bit since the tariff announcement, it remains very close to its record high of around $3,200 per ounce. Also to no surprise, U.S. Treasury bonds have seen a strong bid, with the yield on the 10-year tumbling to 3.89% just ahead of this morning's jobs news, now lower by nearly 100 basis points since President Trump's inauguration. Bitcoin bulls may have been disappointed by the crypto's behavior over the past weeks, with the price seemingly moving tick for tick with the struggling Nasdaq. Signs of a decoupling may be emerging though. Bitcoin on Thursday managed to hold the $80,000 level even as the Nasdaq tumbled throughout the day. Prior to this morning's numbers, BTC was roughly flat in the $82,000 area even as futures pointed to a continuation of the Nasdaq plunge.Next up is March inflation data to be reported next week, with both core and headline CPI still seen hovering around 3%.",

    "content": "Since the start of April, bitcoin (BTC) has experienced an unusual increase in conviction from both short-term and long-term holders. According to Glassnode, short-term holders—those who have held bitcoin for less than 155 days—are typically more reactive to price movements, often buying during periods of euphoria and selling during downturns. However, of late, short-term holders appear to have become value-driven buyers despite bitcoin currently sitting roughly 25% below its all-time high.Since the start of April, this group has grown by around 15,000 BTC, now holding a total of just over 3.7 million BTC. That said, since February, they have distributed approximately 280,000 BTC—likely a mix of profit-taking from the November–December rally, which followed President Donald Trump’s election win. That's in addition to panic selling during bitcoin's 30% drawdown from its January all-time high. Long-term holders—those who have held for at least 155 days – have boosted their coin stash by 400,000 BTC since February, with small amounts acquired this month, taking the overall tally to over 13.5 million. This suggests growing conviction among long-term holders, even amid recent price stagnation. While bitcoin has remained relatively flat since the start of April, Nasdaq is down 3.5% in the same time frame, with futures pointing to a further 3% decline.",

In response, China reportedly imposed its own retaliatory tariffs on April 4.BTC mining firms to &ldquo;lose in the short term&rdquo;Csepcsar also noted that cutting-edge chips for crypto mining are currently massively produced in countries like Taiwan and South Korea, which were hit by new 32% and 25% tariffs, respectively.&ldquo;It will take a decade for the US to catch up with cutting-edge chip manufacturing. So again, companies, including American ones, lose in the short term,&rdquo; he said.Source: jmhorpCsepcsar also observed that some countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States region, including Russia and Kazakhstan, have been beefing up mining efforts and could potentially overtake the US in hashrate dominance.Related: Bitcoin mining using coal energy down 43% since 2011 &mdash; Report&ldquo;If we continue to see trade war, these regions with low tariffs and more favorable mining conditions can see a major boom,&rdquo; Csepcsar warned.As the newly announced tariffs potentially hurt Bitcoin mining both globally and in the US, it may become more difficult for Trump to keep his promise of making the US the global mining leader.Trump&rsquo;s stance on crypto has shifted multiple times over the years.

    "title": "Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin Reverses Gains as China Ramps Up Tariff Retaliation",
    "content": "By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)Major coins reversed early gains after Beijing stepped up trade tensions by announcing retaliatory tariffs following President Donald Trump's Wednesday decision to impose additional levies on China and other nations.Bitcoin dropped to $83,000 from $84,600, though the downside appeared limited, probably because the market's worst fears have finally come true. Markets dislike uncertainty, and the anticipation of a looming threat often creates more anxiety and fear than the actual realization of that threat.Since Trump took office on Jan. 20, markets have been wrestling with the threat of tariffs and a global trade war. That damped investor risk appetite, causing the BTC price to tumble from a record high over $109,000 to below $80,000 last month.This week, Trump announced sweeping tariffs on 180 nations, with higher levies on China, the European Union and Southeast Asia. The effective U.S. tariff rate is now above the level of around 20% set by the 1930's Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act.This so-called tariffagedon moment marks the end of lingering uncertainty and could be liberating for markets, mainly because bond yields have dropped across the advanced world in the aftermath, pricing in disinflation. That's contrary to the popular narrative that tariffs would lead to stagflation — high inflation plus low growth — forcing the Fed to keep interest rates elevated. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond yield has dropped below 4% for the first time since October and yields have fallen sharply in the U.K., Germany and Japan. Plus, oil has declined sharply this week on prospects of higher supply from OPEC countries.All this bodes well for Fed rate cut bets and risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. The same can be said for Friday's March jobs report, which, if it beats estimates, will likely be seen as backward-looking, failing to account for this week's Trump tariffs, while a weak print will only add to Fed rate cuts.With the major macro uncertainty behind us, the crypto market could return to focusing on positive developments, such as USDC issuer Circle's IPO filing and technological advancements.On Thursday, Coinbase Derivatives submitted documentation to the CFTC to self-certify futures for XRP.

Although front-end issues were suspected initially, the team concluded that Base’s scalability limitations were the root cause, a problem they say persists across Ethereum-based chains. Jesse Pollak, the creator of Base, rejected the claims, asserting that Base operated smoothly and did not crash. He emphasized that Base, with a $3.05 billion total value locked and 1.2 million active addresses, had offered support to resolve front-end issues, suggesting the problem was not inherent to the chain.Base developer 'Saedeh' called out Infected’s inexperience, pointing to its introduction of multiple tokens and exaggerated market cap claims as missteps.Derivatives PositioningBTC, ETH puts are trading at a premium relative to calls out to June expiry, representing near-term downside concerns.

    "content": "Update (April 4, 1:45 pm UTC: This article has been updated to add a comment from an OKX spokesperson.Cryptocurrency exchange OKX is under regulatory scrutiny in Europe after Maltese authorities issued a fine for violations of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws in the past.Malta&rsquo;s Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) fined Okcoin Europe &mdash; OKX&rsquo;s Europe-based arm &mdash; 1.1 million euros ($1.2 million) after detecting multiple AML failures on the platform in 2023, the authority announced on April 3.While admitting that OKX has significantly improved its AML policies in the past 18 months, the authority &ldquo;could not ignore&rdquo; its compliance failures from 2023, &ldquo;some of which were deemed to be serious and systematic,&rdquo; the FIAU said.OKX was among the first crypto exchanges to receive a license under Europe&rsquo;s new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation via its Malta hub in January 2025.Specifics of the violationsThe FIAU stated that at the time of the compliance examination in 2023, OKX compiled a business risk assessment (BRA) in an attempt to identify threats and vulnerabilities.The regulators found multiple deficiencies within the BRA&rsquo;s methodology, making OKX unable to properly access the money laundering risks it was exposed to and to take necessary measures to manage them, it said.Some of those risks included potential threats from the use of cryptocurrency mixers or tumblers, privacy coins, stablecoins and the usage of tokens on decentralized exchanges.An excerpt from FIAU&rsquo;s penalty statement to Okcoin Europe. Source: FIAUThe FIAU statement also mentioned money laundering risks associated with Okcoin Europe&rsquo;s exposure to other jurisdictions despite its pledge to only service European customers. It stated:&ldquo;Despite the company&rsquo;s strategy adopted to only service European-based customers, it was essential to also consider the potential [money laundering/financing terrorism exposure emanating from other jurisdictions, including from where the sources of the customers&rsquo; funding originated.&rdquo;A spokesperson for OKX did not respond to Cointelegraph&rsquo;s request to comment on whether the exchange admitted to such wrongdoing in the past.&ldquo;With this chapter behind us, OKX remains focused on the future &mdash; continuing to build a secure, transparent, and compliant platform for our users worldwide,&rdquo; the representative said.Controversy over OKX and Bybit hackThe news on the $1.2 million penalty in Malta came soon after Bloomberg in March reported that European Union regulators were probing OKX over its potential role in facilitating the laundering of $100 million in funds from the Bybit hack.Bybit CEO Ben Zhou previously claimed that OKX&rsquo;s Web3 proxy allowed hackers to launder roughly $100 million, or 40,233 Ether (ETH), from the $1.5 billion hack, which occurred in February 2025.Related: Binance ends Tether USDT trading in Europe to comply with MiCA rulesIn response to Zhou&rsquo;s allegations, OKX denied claims that there were any ongoing investigations by the EU authorities, adding that &ldquo;Bybit&rsquo;s statements are spreading misinformation.&rdquo;Source: OKXThe latest news from Malta&rsquo;s FIAU also followed recent reports suggesting that OKX hired former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to advise it over the federal criminal investigation leading to its plea and a $505 million penalty payment in the US.OKX&rsquo;s new penalty in Malta sets a precedent in the context of regulators dealing with past compliance violations by MiCA-licensed companies, showing that the license does not spare the firms from responsibility for past breaches.Magazine: Stablecoin for cyber-scammers launches, Sony L2 drama: Asia Express",

    "title": "The Great Venture Talent Flux",
    "content": "By Rohit Yadav \n\nWhen is the right moment to shift your company, your role, or even your entire industry?\n\nAsk a dozen people, and you’ll get a dozen different answers. But in venture capital, one thing is clear: we are at the peak of a talent shake-up.\nThe breaking point: 2023-24\nRohit Yadav\n\nLet’s rewind. The bottom of the venture cycle hit in 2023, a year that didn’t just hit valuations and deal flow but also put immense pressure on VC talent.\n\nThe downturn led to frustration, misalignment and career soul-searching. For some, it was a breaking point. For others, a wake-up call.\n\nEither way, it set the stage for one of the most dramatic talent shifts the industry has seen.\n\nWhat fueled this movement? Many factors, among them:\n\n The urge to break free: Many investors are, at their core, entrepreneurs. Some saw 2023 as a catalyst to launch their own firms rather than compete in an overcrowded system.\n Deal flow freeze: A risk-off dealmaking environment left many VCs unable to deploy capital, grow or build their track records, leading to frustration and career stagnation.\n The mega-firm misfit: Large firms often have hierarchies that might stifle rising stars, pushing ambitious partners to carve their paths. Meanwhile, the industry’s shift toward asset management (and away from high-risk, high-reward investing) deepened doubts about staying.\n Burnout and toxicity: Talk of toxic leadership and unhealthy work environments had long existed, but 2023 amplified these frustrations. Some couldn’t ignore internal conflicts and personal challenges anymore.\n Shifting career lanes: Not all VCs fully appreciated their roles. Many started exploring complementary paths, often eyeing operational roles where they could make a more tangible impact.\n Fundraising crunch: Raising capital became an uphill battle as LPs pulled back. With fewer opportunities to grow within, some reconsidered their long-term trajectories.\n AI disruption: The rapid ascent of AI forced firms to reassess their positioning, while some investors jumped ship to chase AI-driven opportunities that their firms weren’t ready — or willing — to embrace.\n The generational shift: For veteran investors, this downturn became a moment of reflection. Some saw it as a natural exit point rather than riding out another decade-plus cycle.\n\nDespite hopes for a rebound, the venture market didn’t reignite in 2024. Recovery was sluggish, and momentum was weak. But one shift was impossible to ignore: VC talent was on the move. What once simmered in the background was now front and center, reshaping the industry in real-time.\nThe talent movement snapshot\n\nCareer moves, like life, aren’t linear. Many of the shifts we saw in the past few quarters might have been brewing for months or even years, and we may never know the real reasons behind every move.\n\nA few notable recent VC moves include Sam Blond of Founder’s Fund, who transitioned from investing to an operational role, while Miles Grimshaw returned to Thrive from Benchmark, and Keith Rabois boomeranged back to Khosla Ventures.\n\nThe urge to build new firms also seemed to accelerate:\n\nMichael Gilroy (ex-Coatue) launched MarathonMP with Gokul Rajaram;\nBilal Zuberi (ex-Lux Capital) started work on a new fund; and\nAnu Hariharan (ex-Y Combinator) forged her path.\n\nOthers had to adapt. Greycroft cut five investors after missing its fundraising goal by 40%, Octopus Ventures laid off 16% of its investment team, and Initialized Capital restructured.\n\nIn Europe, Cavalry Ventures lost its third partner in 2024, while Judith Dada (who left General Catalyst in 2023) moved to Visionaries Club in 2025.\n\nEarly-stage VC also saw notable moves, including Amanda Robson (ex-Cowboy Ventures 1) and Vic Singh (ex-Eniac Ventures) both setting out to start new firms.\nSo, what about 2025?\n\nCareer-defining decisions happen in two key moments: under extreme pressure (like 2023-24) or during peak market euphoria (like 2020-21). Outside these cycles, most stay put. But the last market descent triggered a talent reshuffling that’s still unfolding.\n\nThe best part? There’s still time. This year marks an inflection point. With nine months left, the venture landscape is still in flux but far more optimistic than in 2023-24. This is a rare moment to take control, realign ambitions, reignite networks and embrace reinvention. One thing is clear: The hunger for transformation has never been stronger.\n\nThis year will be defined by bold pivots and quiet recalibrations. Some will take the leap, others will strategically position themselves for moves in the coming quarters and years.\n\nAnd for junior and mid-level VC talent? The opportunity is even bigger. With pressure easing and partner-level transitions reshaping firms, hiring is regaining focus. Now is the time to step up, claim new roles and make bold career moves.\n\nOne thing is undeniable — venture talent is on the move. Are you ready to make yours?\n\nRohit Yadav is the creator of The Big Book of VC, a quarterly insights project known for its “Venture Knowledge Alpha” tagline.

    "content": "Editor’s note: For more Web3 coverage, visit Crunchbase’s Web3 Tracker, where we track startups, investors and funding news in the Web3, cryptocurrency and blockchain space, powered by Crunchbase’s live, comprehensive data.\n\nVenture funding to crypto and blockchain startups more than doubled in the first quarter as crypto enthusiasts seem ready to embrace easing regulations.\n\nHowever, the total dollar figures were heavily skewed by a large $2 billion raise by a crypto exchange with ties to White House.\n\nOverall, venture funding to startups in the crypto and blockchain space — also called Web3 for our purposes here — rocketed to $3.8 billion in 220 deals in Q1, per Crunchbase data. The dollar figure represents a 138% jump from the previous quarter, which saw only $1.6 billion go to Web3 startups in 242 deals.\n\nIt also represents about twice the amount of cash such startups raised in Q1 2024.\nA deeper look\n\nHowever, before any grand announcements of a crypto rebound are made aloud, a deeper look at the numbers shows that that dollar figure was propped up by one big round.\n\nLast month, cryptocurrency exchange Binance received a massive $2 billion investment from Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX. The deal is the single largest investment into a crypto company, beating out FTX’s $1 billion Series B and NYDIG’s $1 billion private equity round in 2021 — both deals raised during the salad days of venture and crypto.\n\nSetting that round aside, Web3 startups raised $1.8 billion last quarter — similar to Q3 and Q4 last year and less than Q2 2024.\n\nDeal flow also continues to shrink, with Q1 seeing fewer than half the number of deals closed during the same quarter a year ago.\n\nThat’s not to say there were not some large deals. San Francisco-based Phantom, a crypto wallet startup, raised a $150 million round led by Paradigm and Sequoia Capital that valued the startup at $3 billion, and Paris-based Flowdesk, a crypto-financial service company building a trading infrastructure, raised a $91.8 million venture round.\nRocky market\n\nThe new White House has energized the Web3 environment — especially in crypto. President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve, and most expect regulation in the crypto industry to ease up substantially under his administration.\n\nHowever, that has not translated into price jumps in the market. Bitcoin was down 9% in Q1, while Ether tumbled 43%.\n\nIronically, the White House may also soon have ties to the newly funded Binance, which pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering laws in 2023. The same day that round was announced it was reported President Trump’s family may take a financial stake in the company, according to The Wall Street Journal. Also that same day, Bloomberg reported that Trump-linked crypto bank World Liberty Financial is in talks with Binance to launch a dollar-pegged stablecoin.\n\nDespite some starts and stops for Web3 in general and crypto in particular, it seems like there is mounting momentum. Some crypto firms even seem to be ready to jump into the tepid IPO waters. Stablecoin issuer Circle filed this week for an offering, and eToro, which operates a trading platform for stocks, cryptocurrencies and other assets, filed for an IPO last month.\n\nInvestors likely will watch those offerings closely as the Web3 sector continues its ups and downs.\nMethodology\n\nFor Web3 funding numbers, we analyze investments made into VC-backed startups in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry group.\nRelated Crunchbase Pro list:\n\nFunding To VC-Backed Web3 Startups\n\nRelated reading:\n\nCrypto Giant Binance Scoops Up $2B From Abu Dhabi’s MGX\nExcitement Builds Around Web3 And Crypto, But VC Dollars Don’t Follow\nWeb3 Funding Gains 43% Year To Year But Dips From Q2\nPublic Raises $135M Series D-2 For AI-Driven Investment\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

    "title": "Cyberattacks by AI agents are coming",
    "content": "Agents are the talk of the AI industry—they’re capable of planning, reasoning, and executing complex tasks like scheduling meetings, ordering groceries, or even taking over your computer to change settings on your behalf. But the same sophisticated abilities that make agents helpful assistants could also make them powerful tools for conducting cyberattacks. They could readily be used to identify vulnerable targets, hijack their systems, and steal valuable data from unsuspecting victims. \n\nAt present, cybercriminals are not deploying AI agents to hack at scale. But researchers have demonstrated that agents are capable of executing complex attacks (Anthropic, for example, observed its Claude LLM successfully replicating an attack designed to steal sensitive information), and cybersecurity experts warn that we should expect to start seeing these types of attacks spilling over into the real world.\n\n“I think ultimately we’re going to live in a world where the majority of cyberattacks are carried out by agents,” says Mark Stockley, a security expert at the cybersecurity company Malwarebytes. “It’s really only a question of how quickly we get there.”\n\nWhile we have a good sense of the kinds of threats AI agents could present to cybersecurity, what’s less clear is how to detect them in the real world. The AI research organization Palisade Research has built a system called LLM Agent Honeypot in the hopes of doing exactly this. It has set up vulnerable servers that masquerade as sites for valuable government and military information to attract and try to catch AI agents attempting to hack in.\n\nThe team behind it hopes that by tracking these attempts in the real world, the project will act as an early warning system and help experts develop effective defenses against AI threat actors by the time they become a serious issue.\n\n“Our intention was to try and ground the theoretical concerns people have,” says Dmitrii Volkov, research lead at Palisade. “We’re looking out for a sharp uptick, and when that happens, we’ll know that the security landscape has changed. In the next few years, I expect to see autonomous hacking agents being told: ‘This is your target. Go and hack it.’”\n\nAI agents represent an attractive prospect to cybercriminals. They’re much cheaper than hiring the services of professional hackers and could orchestrate attacks more quickly and at a far larger scale than humans could. While cybersecurity experts believe that ransomware attacks—the most lucrative kind—are relatively rare because they require considerable human expertise, those attacks could be outsourced to agents in the future, says Stockley. “If you can delegate the work of target selection to an agent, then suddenly you can scale ransomware in a way that just isn’t possible at the moment,” he says. “If I can reproduce it once, then it’s just a matter of money for me to reproduce it 100 times.”\n\nAgents are also significantly smarter than the kinds of bots that are typically used to hack into systems. Bots are simple automated programs that run through scripts, so they struggle to adapt to unexpected scenarios. Agents, on the other hand, are able not only to adapt the way they engage with a hacking target but also to avoid detection—both of which are beyond the capabilities of limited, scripted programs, says Volkov. “They can look at a target and guess the best ways to penetrate it,” he says. “That kind of thing is out of reach of, like, dumb scripted bots.”\n\nSince LLM Agent Honeypot went live in October of last year, it has logged more than 11 million attempts to access it—the vast majority of which were from curious humans and bots. But among these, the researchers have detected eight potential AI agents, two of which they have confirmed are agents that appear to originate from Hong Kong and Singapore, respectively. \n\n“We would guess that these confirmed agents were experiments directly launched by humans with the agenda of something like ‘Go out into the internet and try and hack something interesting for me,’” says Volkov. The team plans to expand its honeypot into social media platforms, websites, and databases to attract and capture a broader range of attackers, including spam bots and phishing agents, to analyze future threats. \n\nTo determine which visitors to the vulnerable servers were LLM-powered agents, the researchers embedded prompt-injection techniques into the honeypot. These attacks are designed to change the behavior of AI agents by issuing them new instructions and asking questions that require humanlike intelligence. This approach wouldn’t work on standard bots.\n\nFor example, one of the injected prompts asked the visitor to return the command “cat8193” to gain access. If the visitor correctly complied with the instruction, the researchers checked how long it took to do so, assuming that LLMs are able to respond in much less time than it takes a human to read the request and type out an answer—typically in under 1.5 seconds. While the two confirmed AI agents passed both tests, the six others only entered the command but didn’t meet the response time that would identify them as AI agents.\n\nExperts are still unsure when agent-orchestrated attacks will become more widespread. Stockley, whose company Malwarebytes named agentic AI as a notable new cybersecurity threat in its 2025 State of Malware report, thinks we could be living in a world of agentic attackers as soon as this year. \n\nAnd although regular agentic AI is still at a very early stage—and criminal or malicious use of agentic AI even more so—it’s even more of a Wild West than the LLM field was two years ago, says Vincenzo Ciancaglini, a senior threat researcher at the security company Trend Micro. \n\n“Palisade Research’s approach is brilliant: basically hacking the AI agents that try to hack you first,” he says. “While in this case we’re witnessing AI agents trying to do reconnaissance, we’re not sure when agents will be able to carry out a full attack chain autonomously. That’s what we’re trying to keep an eye on.” \n\nAnd while it’s possible that malicious agents will be used for intelligence gathering before graduating to simple attacks and eventually complex attacks as the agentic systems themselves become more complex and reliable, it’s equally possible there will be an unexpected overnight explosion in criminal usage, he says: “That’s the weird thing about AI development right now.”\n\nThose trying to defend against agentic cyberattacks should keep in mind that AI is currently more of an accelerant to existing attack techniques than something that fundamentally changes the nature of attacks, says Chris Betz, chief information security officer at Amazon Web Services. “Certain attacks may be simpler to conduct and therefore more numerous; however, the foundation of how to detect and respond to these events remains the same,” he says.\n\nAgents could also be deployed to detect vulnerabilities and protect against intruders, says Edoardo Debenedetti, a PhD student at ETH Zürich in Switzerland, pointing out that if a friendly agent cannot find any vulnerabilities in a system, it’s unlikely that a similarly capable agent used by a malicious party is going to be able to find any either.\n\nWhile we know that AI’s potential to autonomously conduct cyberattacks is a growing risk and that AI agents are already scanning the internet, one useful next step is to evaluate how good agents are at finding and exploiting these real-world vulnerabilities. Daniel Kang, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and his team have built a benchmark to evaluate this; they have found that current AI agents successfully exploited up to 13% of vulnerabilities for which they had no prior knowledge. Providing the agents with a brief description of the vulnerability pushed the success rate up to 25%, demonstrating how AI systems are able to identify and exploit weaknesses even without training. Basic bots would presumably do much worse.\n\nThe benchmark provides a standardized way to assess these risks, and Kang hopes it can guide the development of safer AI systems. “I’m hoping that people start to be more proactive about the potential risks of AI and cybersecurity before it has a ChatGPT moment,” he says. “I’m afraid people won’t realize this until it punches them in the face.”",

    "content": "The U.S. stock-market slide prompted by President Donald Trump's global tariff announcement on Wednesday sent the Nasdaq Composite Index into one of its biggest funks since the start of the century.The tech-heavy index lost 5.5% on Thursday, just outside the top 20 worst single-day drawdowns since 2000, according to Investing.com. Most of the largest drawdowns occurred during the dot-com crash of 2000-2001 and the 2008 global financial crisis. Other equity measures also suffered, with the S&P 500 index falling almost 5%.In contrast, the bitcoin (BTC) price, which is typically correlated with U.S. equities over short timeframes, bucked the trend. The largest cryptocurrency, which tumbled immediately after the announcement while stock markets were closed, rose 0.7% the following day, with momentum carrying into Friday, according to Glassnode data. Bitcoin is now trading above $84,000 compared with about $87,000 before Trump started speaking. Nasdaq futures, meanwhile, are lower ahead of the U.S. jobs report due later in the day.Bitcoin made its 2025 low in mid-March at around $76,000, whereas the Nasdaq hit a low on Thursday. Year-to-date, bitcoin is outperforming the Nasdaq, losing 10% against the index's 11%.Analyst Caleb Franzen highlighted bitcoin's relative strength compared with the S&P 500 in this risk-off environment, noting its resilience around the 200-day moving average.\"It's pretty remarkable to see that bitcoin is up +3.4% today relative to the S&P 500, particularly in a risk-off environment.

    "title": "March Jobs Report a 'Heads I Win, Tails You Lose' Moment for Bitcoin Bulls",
    "content": "As the pivotal U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report for March approaches, bitcoin (BTC) bulls find themselves in a situation reminiscent of the character Two-Face (Harvey Dent) from the movie \"The Dark Knight,\" who flips coins to make decisions, confident of controlling the fate irrespective of the outcome.It's a classic case of \"heads I win, tails you lose,\" which means that bitcoin bulls will likely come out on top after the impending jobs report, regardless of whether the data reveals labor market strength or weakness.This situation arises from President Donald Trump's Wednesday announcement of sweeping tariffs affecting 180 nations, prompting forward-looking markets to price in recession risks and expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts.Consequently, stronger-than-expected jobs data, which typically strengthens the dollar and pressures risk assets like BTC, may be dismissed as outdated, overlooking the recent developments resulting from Trump's policies. Therefore, any dip in BTC following a potentially hot NFP report could be swiftly reversed, leading to gains.On the other hand, weak data would only add to recession fears and bolster Fed rate cut bets, supporting increased risk-taking in financial markets.At press time, bitcoin changed hands at $84,190, having hit lows below $82,000 Thursday, per CoinDesk data. The fact that prices have stayed well above the $77,000 March low despite peak tariff uncertainty indicates seller fatigue and potential for a price rise.Volmex's bitcoin one-day implied volatility index stood at an annualized 65%, indicating an expected price swing of 3.4% in the next 24 hours.The jobs data is due at 12:30 UTC. According to FactSet, the median estimate for total nonfarm payroll employment in March is 130,000, down from February's 151,000 tally. The jobless rate is forecast to have risen to 4.2% from 4.1%.Ahead of the data release, rates traders are pricing 100 basis points of Fed rate cuts this year, with the first move expected to happen in June, according to the CME's FedWatch tool.",

    "content": "Solana's SOL token is poised for a potential price swing of almost 6% after some large investors, or whales, dumped their holdings ahead of the U.S. non-farm payroll (NFP) report due later Friday.This estimate comes from Volmex's one-day implied volatility index (IV) for SOL. At press time, the index showed a one-day reading annualized at 109.70%, indicating an expected 24-hour price volatility of 5.74%. (The daily figure is derived by dividing the annualized volatility by the square root of 365, the number of trading days in a year.)A movement that size represents moderate volatility, especially considering that the cryptocurrency has experienced several days of 6% or higher volatility since early March, according to data from CoinDesk.In other words, the market is likely to be volatile, but nothing out of the ordinary.Whale sellingData tracked by blockchain sleuth Lookonchain shows several whales unstaked and dumped SOL worth $46.3 million into the market.Large offloading of coins by whales often leads to bearish price action. However, the amount sold early today equates to 0.97% of the cryptocurrency's 24-hour trading volume of $4.7 billion.So, it's no surprise that SOL is trading little changed at around $116, having printed a low of $112 on Thursday. Broadly speaking, the cryptocurrency has been in a downtrend since reaching a high of $295 on Jan. 19.Focus on payrollsThe U.S. jobs data, scheduled for release at 12:30 GMT, is forecast to reveal that the economy added 130,000 jobs in March, slowdown from February's 151,000 and well below the 12-month average of 162,300, according to FactSet.The median estimate for the jobless rate for March is is 4.2%, the highest since November and up from February's 4.1% reading. Average hourly earnings are forecast to have risen 0.3% month-on-month, matching February's pace.A weaker-than-expected figure will likely validate renewed pricing for four 25-basis-point interest-rate cuts this year, potentially sending risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, higher.",

    "title": "Trump’s tariffs will deliver a big blow to climate tech",
    "content": "US president Donald Trump’s massive, sweeping tariffs sent global stock markets tumbling on Thursday, setting the stage for a worldwide trade war and ratcheting up the dangers of a punishing recession. \n\nExperts fear that the US cleantech sector is especially vulnerable to a deep downturn, which would undermine the nation’s progress on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and undercut its leadership in an essential, growing industry.\n\n“It would be hard for me to think of cleantech or climate tech sectors that aren’t facing huge risks,” says Noah Kaufman, senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, who served on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Joe Biden. \n\n“I think we’re a country without a federal climate strategy at this point, with an economy headed in the wrong direction, so I don’t see a lot of reason to be optimistic,” he adds.\n\nHow deep and wide-ranging the impact of the coming economic shifts could be depends on many variables still in play and on reactions still to come. In particular, the negotiations underway in Congress over the budget will determine the fate of subsidies for electric vehicles, battery production, and other clean technologies. Many of those programs were established by former president Biden’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBut there are mounting challenges and rising risks across the cleantech and climate tech sectors. Notably any slowdown in the broader economy threatens to tighten corporate and venture capital funding for startups working on carbon removal, synthetic aviation fuels, electric delivery vehicles, and other technologies that help companies meet climate action goals. \n\nIn addition, Trump’s tariffs, particularly the now 54% levy on Chinese goods, will push up the costs of key components for many businesses. Notably, the US imported $4 billion worth of lithium-ion batteries from China during the first four months of last year, so the tariff increase would impose a huge tax on products that go into electric vehicles, laptops, phones, and many other devices. \n\nHigher prices for aluminum, steel, copper, cement, and numerous other goods and materials will also drive up the costs of doing all sorts of business, including building wind turbines, solar farms, and geothermal plants. And if China, Canada, the European Union, and other nations respond with retaliatory trade measures, as is widely expected, it will also become harder or more expensive for US companies to export goods like EVs or battery components to overseas markets. \n\nEven traditional energy stocks took a beating on Wall Street Thursday, out of fear that any broader economic sluggishness will drive down electricity demand.\n\nTrump administration cuts to the Department of Energy and other federal programs could also take away money from demonstration projects that help cleantech companies test and scale up their technologies. And if Congress does eliminate certain subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act, it could halt billion-dollar projects that are being planned or perhaps even some that are already under construction.\n\nThe growing policy uncertainty and weakening economic conditions alone may already be causing some of this to occur.\n\nSince Trump took office, companies have canceled, delayed, or scaled back at least nine US “clean energy supply chain” developments or operations, according to the Big Green Machine, a database maintained by Jay Turner, a professor of environmental studies at Wellesley College, and student researchers there. The projects that have been affected represent some $8 billion in public and private investments, and more than 9,000 jobs.\n\nThey include KORE Power’s planned battery facility in Arizona, which the company halted; Envision Automotive Energy Supply’s paused expansion in Florence County, South Carolina; and Akasol’s closure of two plants in Michigan. \n\nVW also scaled back production at its recently expanded EV factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, amid slower-than-expected growth in sales and, perhaps, the expectation that the Trump administration will strive to roll back consumer tax credits for vehicle purchases.\n\n“The biggest challenge for companies that are making hundred-million- or billion-dollar capital investments is dealing with the uncertainty,” Turner says. “Uncertainty is a real deterrent to making big bets.” \n\nVenture capital investments in clean energy have been cooling for a while. They peaked at $24.5 billion in 2022 and settled at around $18 billion annually during the last two years, according to data provided by Pitchbook. First-quarter figures for this year aren’t yet available, though industry watchers are keen to see where they land. \n\nSome parts of the cleantech sector could hold up better than others through the Trump administration and any upcoming economic gloom. \n\nThe Pitchbook report, for instance, noted that the surge in development of AI data centers is fueling demand for “dispatchable energy sources.” That means the type that can run around the clock, such as nuclear fission, fusion, and geothermal (though in practice, the data center boom has often meant commissioning or relying on natural-gas plants that produce planet-warming emissions).\n\nTrump’s new energy secretary, Chris Wright, previously the chief executive of the oilfield services company Liberty Energy, has also talked favorably about nuclear power and geothermal—and rather unfavorably about renewables like solar and wind. \n\nBut observers fear that more sectors will lose than win in any economic downturn to come, and Turner stresses that the decisions made during this administration could last well beyond it.\n\n“The near-term concern is that this emerging clean-energy industry in the US suffers a significant pullback and the US cedes this market to other countries, especially China, that are actively working to position themselves to be leaders in the clean-energy future,” he says. \n\nThe long-term concern, he adds, is that if government policies on cleantech simply advance and retreat with the whims of each administration, companies will stop trying to make long-term investments that bank on such subsidies, grants or loans. \n\nCatherine Wolfram, a professor of energy and applied economics at MIT, also notes that China and the European Union are forging ahead in developing policies to drive down emissions and build up carbon-free sectors. She observes that they’re both now moving on to the tougher work of cleaning up heavy industries like steel, while the US is “losing ground on even making clean electricity.”\n\n“It’s the worst kind of US exceptionalism,” she says.",

    "title": "Q1 Global Startup Funding Posts Strongest Quarter Since Q2 2022 With A Third Going To Massive OpenAI Deal  ",
    "content": "Both the largest startup funding round ever and the largest acquisition of a venture-backed company occurred in Q1 2025, reflecting a warming startup environment but also one where capital and opportunities were concentrated among a handful of companies and sectors.\n\nOverall, the quarter marked the strongest one for venture investment since Q2 2022.\n\nBut the quarterly numbers were significantly buoyed by a single round: OpenAI raised the largest private round ever, a $40 billion funding that values the company at $300 billion.\n\nThe deal — which alone accounts for more than half of U.S. venture funding and a third of global funding last quarter — pushed global startup investment in Q1 to $113 billion, Crunchbase data shows. Funding to just the AI sector comprised more than half of last quarter’s global total.\n\nTotal startup funding in Q1 was up 17% quarter over quarter from $96 billion in Q4 2024 and up 54% year over year from $73 billion in Q1 2024.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBillions more in funding\nU.S. gained\nStrongest M&A quarter since 2021\nAI capital concentrated\nLate stage was up\nEarly stage trails\nSeed falls\nCapEx and concentration\nMethodology\nGlossary of funding terms\n\nBillions more in funding\n\nOpenAI moved from the third-most valuable private company to the second-most valuable after SpaceX, which is currently valued at $350 billion. OpenAI has raised a total of $57.6 billion since its founding in 2015. The latest round represents more than two-thirds of the San Francisco-based company’s total funding since it was founded, adding to the $6.6 billion it raised in Q4.\n\nCompetitor Anthropic also raised billions in funding in Q1, but even so, it was a fraction of what OpenAI raised. Anthropic raised $4.5 billion across two funding rounds, after raising $4 billion in Q4.\n\nGenerative AI companies were not the only companies to raise billion-dollar rounds in Q1. U.S.-based immersive reality company Infinite Reality raised $3 billion, and crypto asset company Binance raised $2 billion.\n\nBy comparison, the peak quarter of 2024 was Q4 with $96 billion in total funding. That quarter included a spate of billion-dollar rounds to U.S.-based data and AI companies. Databricks, OpenAI, xAI and Anthropic collectively raised $26.6 billion — a quarter of global funding.\nU.S. gained\n\nVenture funding to U.S. companies totaled $80 billion in Q1 2025, accounting for around 71% of global funding. Funding to Bay Area-based companies alone reached $55 billion, accounting for 69% of U.S. venture capital funding and 49% of global funding.\nStrongest M&A quarter since 2021\n\nQ1 2025 was also the strongest quarter for startup M&A dollar volume since 2021, totaling $71 billion in reported exit value.\n\nWiz’s acquisition by Google, if finalized, will mark the largest acquisition for a private company with a price tag of $32 billion. The deal is still subject to regulatory approval.\n\nIn total, there were 12 acquisitions above $1 billion for venture-backed startups. The most notable include Ampere’s acquisition by SoftBank, Modernizing Medicine’s purchase by Clearlake Capital Group, Moveworks’ acquisition by ServiceNow, and Weights & Biases’ purchase by CoreWeave.\n\nWhile the dollar volume for global M&A was high, deal counts for the quarter came in at more than 500, but remained well below market peak quarters of the around 800 global M&A deals seen in 2021, Crunchbase data shows.\n\nGlobal M&A for venture-backed companies averaged $63 billion each quarter in 2021, with a peak quarter that year at $71 billion, Crunchbase data shows.\nAI capital concentrated\n\nAI was the leading sector for venture funding in the first quarter, with $59.6 billion invested. Last quarter marked the strongest quarter for AI funding ever, with an astonishing 53% of global funding going to the AI sector alone.\n\nThis followed a strong fourth quarter when $44 billion was raised by AI startups globally.\n\nHealthcare and biotech was the second-largest sector for funding in Q1, with $18 billion invested. Financial services companies, the third-largest sector in the quarter, totaled $10.8 billion.\n\nLate stage was up\n\nLate-stage funding in the first quarter gained quarter over quarter. Funding reached $81 billion, up more than 30% quarter over quarter and an increase of 147% year over year from the $33 billion invested in Q1 2024, Crunchbase data shows.\n\nEarly stage trails\n\nEarly-stage funding was slightly down in Q1 reaching $24 billion. Larger Series A and B rounds were led by the healthcare and biotech sector. Large rounds were also found in robotics, AI and cloud services, among other sectors.\n\nSeed falls\n\nSeed funding reached $7.2 billion in Q1, down 14% from $8.4 billion invested a year ago. (Seed funding totals typically increase over time, as many seed rounds are added to the Crunchbase dataset after the close of a quarter.)\n\nCapEx and concentration\n\nThe venture markets are adapting to the massive opportunities that AI unleashes and the imposing costs of its computation. Last quarter tells that story, with more than a third of capital invested in a single company, OpenAI.\n\nValuations are increasing at a faster pace. The Crunchbase Unicorn Board has added around $400 billion in value in the first quarter — from  the 29 companies that joined and from existing unicorns that raised rounds at higher values. The board reached $1 trillion in total funding in January this year and currently tops $5.8 trillion in value.\n\nThe IPO markets for tech companies were slow in Q1. The most high-profile company to go public was New Jersey-based CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure cloud service provider. Its shares priced below their range at $40 per share, but have since seen a significant uptick in price.\n\nWith future large outcomes, M&A has heated up, providing some much-needed liquidity to the venture capital industry.\nMethodology\n\nThe data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of April 2, 2025.\n\nNote that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.\n\nPlease note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.\nGlossary of funding terms\n\nSeed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.\n\nEarly-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.\n\nLate-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round.\n\nTechnology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

    "title": "Tariff-Induced Market Meltdown Worrisome For Startup Valuations And Exits",
    "content": "Unlike public companies, private startup valuations don’t fluctuate massively from day to day based on current events.\n\nEventually, however, private company prices do adjust to reflect trends in the broader markets.\n\nAnd based on what we’re seeing today, things look worrisome.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index was down a staggering 4.8% in midday trading today, following President Trump’s decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imported goods. His order calls for a 10% baseline tariff, along with much higher rates for many countries.\n\nAmong its myriad impacts, the decision is expected to lead to higher consumer prices and depressed demand as manufacturers and retailers pass along tariff costs incurred by their businesses. That was reflected in some of today’s more pronounced drops 1 for tech and consumer bellwethers, including Amazon (down 7%), Apple (down 8%),  Nike (down 10%), and Wayfair (down 25%).\nStartup correction delayed?\n\nNow, over in startupland, we’re not seeing immediate revaluations. For hot startups, repricings might happen once every few months or quarters when there’s a new funding round. And ordinarily, it’s common for companies to go a couple years between revaluations.\n\nThat means the $300 billion post-money valuation announced for OpenAI this week, and the $113 billion valuation set for the newly combined X and xAI aren’t seeing an instant price cut like leading AI chip supplier Nvidia (down 5%).\n\nBut looking ahead, the trajectory appears concerning.\n\nFor one, it’s only a couple years since the last massive startup valuation correction. Scores of companies that enjoyed unicorn status around the market peak in late 2021 later settled for down rounds, folded or filed for bankruptcy.\n\nIn addition, the tech IPO market was sluggish in 2023 and 2024, and only just recently shows signs of warming up. We had a mega-offering last week from CoreWeave, which had a recent market cap around $24 billion. Large offerings from Klarna and Circle are also expected to hit markets in coming weeks.\n\nIn a similar vein, M&A was also on the rise, led by Google’s planned $32 billion purchase of cybersecurity unicorn Wiz, and a bump in billion-dollar-plus acquisitions.\n\nSo, for startup exits, we were finally getting out of a slump, only to face a new obstacle in the form of a tariff-driven market pullback.\nDumb + unpopular = a case for optimism\n\nLooking for a case for optimism in the current scenario, I find myself turning to reality TV. The principle of this media niche has long been that one can succeed with something dumb, so long as it’s popular. However, if a show is both pointlessly stupid and not fun to watch, it will flop.\n\nThe same notion applies to a lot of other areas, including movies, music, romance novels, podcasts, and the list goes on. So why not new tariffs?\n\nAs public markets have demonstrated today, investors find the current tariff moves both dumb and unpopular. Hopefully, those with power to revise foolish decisions will take this as a reason to reverse course. I’m not giving it the highest likelihood, but it’s at least within the realm of possibility.\nRelated reading:\n\nWith Google’s $32B Bid For Wiz, Big Exits Are Finally Picking Up\nA Booming Start To The Year For The Billion-Dollar Exits Board\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman\n\nBased on prices at around noon ET.&#8617;",

    "title": "What Is DevSecOps And Why Does It Matter In The Age Of AI?",
    "content": "By Sanket Saurav\n\nInterest in DevSecOps has surged in recent years — but many people probably don’t know what it is, or why it has become especially important for tech companies in the age of AI.\n\nWhen building software, someone has to make sure it doesn’t contain bugs that can later be exploited by bad actors. Today’s AI code generation tools can produce vast amounts of code quickly, but often with many hidden vulnerabilities. Adopting DevSecOps helps tech companies mitigate these risks, but it’s a relatively new approach.\n\nTwenty years ago, most companies deployed their code using three teams: development (writing code), operations (deployment) and security, which usually reviewed the code for vulnerabilities just before shipping. Security was often a reactive step occurring late in the process.\n\nDevelopment and operations eventually merged into DevOps, and in recent years, it became clear that security should be as close to the development process as possible, not an afterthought. DevSecOps was born. A number of changes have made it especially important for tech teams to adopt a robust DevSecOps strategy.\nAI-generated code has intensified security needs\nSanket Saurav of DeepSource\n\nWith today’s generative AI tools, five developers can generate the work of 20 people. However, automation for code security has not kept pace, creating huge gaps in security compliance. Human reviewers simply can’t deal with the surge in volume.\n\nStudies on AI-generated code found that almost half the code had bugs that could lead to harmful exploitation. Every company today needs to be using automated code security tools — namely static application security testing, or SAST, software — so the code they’re rapidly shipping out doesn’t shoot them in the foot tomorrow.\nDevelopers are relying more on open source\n\nSoftware developers have been integrating much more open-source code into their projects in recent years, meaning they depend on code that’s been developed externally and repeatedly modified by individual contributors. Each open-source “package” uses an entire chain of third-party code: The average open-source JavaScript package relies on 377 third-party packages, and up to 90% of applications’ code is estimated to be open-sourced.\n\nDevelopers have far less control over the quality and security of these “dependencies.” Real-life examples of this happening include Log4j, a widely used open-source program that had a serious security flaw allowing hackers to take control of devices that used it.\n\nDevSecOps tools such as Software Composition Analysis, or SCA, analyze those open-source components of a codebase for any security vulnerabilities. Because they can do so rapidly and at scale, they can better insulate security-conscious teams.\nSoftware releases have become more frequent\n\nWhile a few years ago, traditional development cycles allowed time for manual security reviews  (releases happened every few weeks), software releases now get deployed every few hours. Faster deployments risk creating a “security debt” that compounds with each release.\n\nIt’s particularly important for automated tools to step in to secure that continuous deployment, or the security debt could lead to vulnerability proliferation, as each undetected flaw becomes the foundation for dozens of dependent features.\nEven smaller startups are being asked to meet security standards\n\nWhile larger companies typically have DevSecOps capabilities, smaller startups have often focused on product development over security. But nowadays, enterprises purchasing B2B SaaS are compelling those providers to obtain SOC2 Type 2 compliance, which demands a holistic security program.\n\nThat can’t be done without a robust code security strategy and tooling in place.\n\nCode security has always been an important part of software development, but recent trends have shifted security closer to the active software development process, and therefore increased the need for fast and efficient security tools.\n\nSanket Saurav is the co-founder and CEO of DeepSource, a company with a mission to help developers write secure code with static analysis and AI.\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

    "title": "Eye On AI: Massive OpenAI Deal Masks AI’s Slow Quarter",
    "content": "This column is a look back at the week that was in AI. Read the previous one here.\n\nThe big news in the world of venture and artificial intelligence obviously has been OpenAI&#8216;s massive $40 billion investment led by SoftBank.\n\nThat big-money deal has folks talking, but a deeper look at the funding numbers for AI in Q1 seem to show a slight pullback from investors, in both the private and public markets, as more questions arise concerning how much large enterprises will continue (or start in some cases) throwing at AI tools.\nPrivate market\n\nAs our first-quarter 2025 global venture funding report illustrates, AI funding was again at an all-time high — just as it was in Q4 2024.\n\nAfter hitting nearly $44 billion in Q4, total venture funding to AI startups was almost $60 billion in the first quarter of this year. While that seems impressive — and it is, to a certain extent — it’s hard to ignore the fact that two-thirds of that amount is directly related to one company and its massive raise led by SoftBank.\n\nIf we put that to the side, AI startups in Q1 raised less than half of what was doled out in Q4 last year, getting about $19.6 billion, per Crunchbase data. The biggest deal — aside from OpenAI’s — of the quarter saw Anthropic, a ChatGPT rival with its AI assistant Claude, raise a $3.5 billion funding round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners that valued it at $61.5 billion.\n\nThere were many massive deals for AI startups in Q4, including Databricks’ $10 billion round, OpenAI’s long-awaited raise of $6.6 billion, and xAI’s $6 billion in a funding round. In fact, there were 11 rounds of $500 million or more, while Q1 saw just five.\n\nIf one takes that $19.6 billion total, it would be the lowest for a quarter since AI startups raised only $13.9 billion in Q1 2024.\n\nDeal flow for AI startups also dipped in Q1 of this year, with only 1,226 deals announced — marking a roughly 25% drop from Q1 last year and more than 150 rounds fewer than Q4.\nPublic market\n\nBut it’s not just about the private market and venture capital. The poster-child for AI on the public market, Nvidia, had a bad quarter in the stock market in Q1, with shares dropping more than 20%, while semiconductor company AMD’s shares shaved off nearly 15%.\n\nShares of Oracle, a big player in the U.S.’ new AI endeavor, The Stargate Project, dropped more than 15% for the quarter. The Nasdaq Composite Index — a good general indicator of how tech stocks are faring — was down about 10% for the quarter.\n\nOf course, the big news on the public market was CoreWeave’s IPO, but the big event barely made any waves as the stock remained relatively flat after premiering (even after the offering significantly shrank in size).\nCautious investing\n\nCoreWeave’s IPO  — which had been looked at as a bellwether for the expected thawing of the IPO market — may be the best illustration of investors starting to take a hard look at what’s going on in a heated market.\n\nAs the IPO approached, there seemed to be more questions and concerns being voiced about how quickly AI adoption will happen for many large companies and how much they are willing to allocate to data center spend. There is also worry that with so many data centers being built, supply could outstrip demand and lower prices.\n\nOf course, Q2 may be an entirely different story in both the private and public markets, and the OpenAI round did, in fact, happen, so that investment can’t just be discounted.\n\nHowever, there is also a chance investors are starting to look more closely at AI and where the market for spend on the technology is actually going.\n\nThat would be something different.\nRelated Crunchbase Pro query:\n\nRounds Raised By Startups Using AI\n\nRelated reading:\n\nCoreWeave Shrinks IPO\nEye On AI: AI Venture Funding Shattered Quarterly Records In Q4\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

    "title": "We should talk more about air-conditioning",
    "content": "Things are starting to warm up here in the New York City area, and it’s got me thinking once again about something that people aren’t talking about enough: energy demand for air conditioners. \n\nI get it: Data centers are the shiny new thing to worry about. And I’m not saying we shouldn’t be thinking about the strain that gigawatt-scale computing installations put on the grid. But a little bit of perspective is important here.\n\nAccording to a report from the International Energy Agency last year, data centers will make up less than 10% of the increase in energy demand between now and 2030, far less than the energy demand from space cooling (mostly air-conditioning).\n\nI just finished up a new story that’s out today about a novel way to make heat exchangers, a crucial component in air conditioners and a whole host of other technologies that cool our buildings, food, and electronics. Let’s dig into why I’m writing about the guts of cooling technologies, and why this sector really needs innovation. \n\nOne twisted thing about cooling and climate change: It’s all a vicious cycle. As temperatures rise, the need for cooling technologies increases. In turn, more fossil-fuel power plants are firing up to meet that demand, turning up the temperature of the planet in the process.\n\n“Cooling degree days” are one measure of the need for additional cooling. Basically, you take a preset baseline temperature and figure out how much the temperature exceeds it. Say the baseline (above which you’d likely need to flip on a cooling device) is 21 °C (70 °F). If the average temperature for a day is 26 °C, that’s five cooling degree days on a single day. Repeat that every day for a month, and you wind up with 150 cooling degree days.\n\nI explain this arguably weird metric because it’s a good measure of total energy demand for cooling—it lumps together both how many hot days there are and just how hot it is. \n\nAnd the number of cooling degree days is steadily ticking up globally. Global cooling degree days were 6% higher in 2024 than in 2023, and 20% higher than the long-term average for the first two decades of the century. Regions that have high cooling demand, like China, India, and the US, were particularly affected, according to the IEA report. You can see a month-by-month breakdown of this data from the IEA here.\n\nThat increase in cooling degree days is leading to more demand for air conditioners, and for energy to power them. Air-conditioning accounted for 7% of the world’s electricity demand in 2022, and it’s only going to get more important from here.\n\nThere were fewer than 2 billion AC units in the world in 2016. By 2050, that could be nearly 6 billion, according to a 2018 report from the IEA. This is a measure of progress and, in a way, something we should be happy about; the number of air conditioners tends to rise with household income. But it does present a challenge to the grid.  \n\nAnother piece of this whole thing: It’s not just about how much total electricity we need to run air conditioners but about when that demand tends to come. As we’ve covered in this newsletter before, your air-conditioning habits aren’t unique. Cooling devices tend to flip on around the same time—when it’s hot. In some parts of the US, for example, air conditioners can represent more than 70% of residential energy demand at times when the grid is most stressed.\n\nThe good news is that we’re seeing innovations in cooling technology. Some companies are building cooling systems that include an energy storage component, so they can charge up when energy is plentiful and demand is low. Then they can start cooling when it’s most needed, without sucking as much energy from the grid during peak hours.\n\nWe’ve also covered alternatives to air conditioners called desiccant cooling systems, which use special moisture-sucking materials to help cool spaces and deal with humidity more efficiently than standard options.\n\nAnd in my latest story, I dug into new developments in heat exchanger technology. Heat exchangers are a crucial component of air conditioners, but you can really find them everywhere—in heat pumps, refrigerators, and, yes, the cooling systems in large buildings and large electronics installations, including data centers.\n\nWe’ve been building heat exchangers basically the same way for nearly a century. These components basically move heat around, and there are a few known ways to do so with devices that are relatively straightforward to manufacture. Now, though, one team of researchers has 3D-printed a heat exchanger that outperforms some standard designs and rivals others. This is still a long way from solving our looming air-conditioning crisis, but the details are fascinating—I hope you’ll give it a read. \n\nWe need more innovation in cooling technology to help meet global demand efficiently so we don’t stay stuck in this cycle. And we’ll need policy and public support to make sure that these technologies make a difference and that everyone has access to them too. \n\nThis article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review’s weekly climate newsletter.

    "title": "Rivals are rising to challenge the dominance of SpaceX",
    "content": "SpaceX is a space launch juggernaut. In just two decades, the company has managed to edge out former aerospace heavyweights Boeing, Lockheed, and Northrop Grumman to gain near-monopoly status over rocket launches in the US; it accounted for 87% of the country’s orbital launches in 2024, according to an analysis by SpaceNews. Since the mid-2010s, the company has dominated NASA’s launch contracts and become a major Pentagon contractor. It is now also the go-to launch provider for commercial customers, having lofted numerous satellites and five private crewed spaceflights, with more to come. \n\nOther space companies have been scrambling to compete for years, but developing a reliable rocket takes slow, steady work and big budgets. Now at least some of them are catching up. \n\nA host of companies have readied rockets that are comparable to SpaceX’s main launch vehicles. The list includes Rocket Lab, which aims to take on SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9 with its Neutron rocket and could have its first launch in late 2025, and Blue Origin, owned by Jeff Bezos, which recently completed the first mission of a rocket it hopes will compete against SpaceX’s Starship. \n\nSome of these competitors are just starting to get rockets off the ground. And the companies could also face unusual headwinds, given that SpaceX’s Elon Musk has an especially close relationship with the Trump administration and has allies at federal regulatory agencies, including those that provide oversight of the industry.\n\nBut if all goes well, the SpaceX challengers can help improve access to space and prevent bottlenecks if one company experiences a setback. “More players in the market is good for competition,” says Chris Combs, an aerospace engineer at the University of Texas at San Antonio. “I think for the foreseeable future it will still be hard to compete with SpaceX on price.” But, he says, the competitors could push SpaceX itself to become better and provide those seeking access to space with a wider array of options..\n\nA big lift\n\nThere are a few reasons why SpaceX was able to cement its position in the space industry. When it began in the 2000s, it had three consecutive rocket failures and seemed poised to fold. But it barreled through with Musk’s financial support, and later with a series of NASA and defense contracts. It has been a primary beneficiary of NASA’s commercial space program, developed in the 2010s with the intention of propping up the industry. \n\n“They got government contracts from the very beginning,” says Victoria Samson, a space policy expert at the Secure World Foundation in Broomfield, Colorado. “I wouldn’t say it’s a handout, but SpaceX would not exist without a huge influx of repeated government contracts. To this day, they’re still dependent on government customers, though they have commercial customers too.”\n\nSpaceX has also effectively achieved a high degree of vertical integration, Samson points out: It owns almost all parts of its supply chain, designing, building, and testing all its major hardware components in-house, with a minimal use of suppliers. That gives it not just control over its hardware but considerably lower costs, and the price tag is the top consideration for launch contracts. \n\nThe company was also open to taking risks other industry stalwarts were not. “I think for a very long time the industry looked at spaceflight as something that had to be very precise and perfect, and not a lot of room for tinkering,” says Combs. “SpaceX really was willing to take some risks and accept failure in ways that others haven’t been. That’s easier to do when you’re backed by a billionaire.” \n\nWhat’s finally enabled international and US-based competitors to emerge has been a growing customer base looking for launch services, along with some investors’ deep pockets. \n\nSome of these companies are taking aim at SpaceX’s Falcon 9, which can lift as much as about 20,000 kilograms into orbit and is used for sending multiple satellites or the crewed Dragon into space. “There is a practical monopoly in the medium-lift launch market right now, with really only one operational vehicle,” says Murielle Baker, a spokesperson for Rocket Lab, a US-New Zealand company.\n\nRocket Lab plans to take on the Falcon 9 with its Neutron rocket, which is expected to have its inaugural flight later this year from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. The effort is building on the success of the company’s smaller Electron rocket, and Neutron’s first stage is intended to be reusable after it parachutes down to the ocean. \n\nAnother challenger is Texas-based Firefly, whose Alpha rocket can be launched from multiple spaceports so that it can reach different orbits. Firefly has already secured NASA and Space Force contracts, with more launches coming this year (and on March 2 it also became the second private company to successfully land a spacecraft on the moon). Next year, Relativity Space aims to loft its first Terran R rocket, which is partially built from 3D-printed components. And the Bill Gates–backed Stoke Space aims to launch its reusable Nova rocket in late 2025 or, more likely, next year.\n\nCompetitors are also rising for SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, holding out the prospect of more options for sending massive payloads to higher orbits and deep space. Furthest along is the Vulcan Centaur rocket, a creation of United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. It’s expected to have its third and fourth launches in the coming months, delivering Space Force satellites to orbit. Powered by engines from Blue Origin, the Vulcan Centaur is slightly wider and shorter than the Falcon rockets. It currently isn’t reusable, but it’s less expensive than its predecessors, ULA’s Atlas V and Delta IV, which are being phased out. \n\nMark Peller, the company’s senior vice president on Vulcan development and advanced programs, says the new rocket comes with multiple advantages. “One is overall value, in terms of dollars per pound to orbit and what we can provide to our customers,” he says, “and the second is versatility: Vulcan was designed to go to a range of orbits.” He says more than 80 missions are already lined up. \n\nVulcan’s fifth flight, slated for no earlier than May, will launch the long-awaited Sierra Space Dream Chaser, a spaceplane that can carry cargo (and possibly crew) to the International Space Station. ULA also has upcoming Vulcan launches planned for Amazon’s Kuiper satellite constellation, a potential Starlink rival.\n\nMeanwhile, though it took a few years, Blue Origin now has a truly orbital heavy-lift spacecraft: In January, it celebrated the inaugural launch of its towering New Glenn, a rocket that’s only a bit shorter than NASA’s Space Launch System and SpaceX’s Starship. Future flights could launch national security payloads. \n\nCompetition is emerging abroad as well. After repeated delays, Europe’s heavy-lift Ariane 6, from Airbus subsidiary Arianespace, had its inaugural flight last year, ending the European Space Agency’s temporary dependence on SpaceX. A range of other companies are trying to expand European launch capacity, with assistance from ESA.\n\nChina is moving quickly on its own launch organizations too. “They had no less than seven ‘commercial’ space launch companies that were all racing to develop an effective system that could deliver a payload into orbit,” Kari Bingen, director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says of China’s efforts. “They are moving fast and they have capital behind them, and they will absolutely be a competitor on the global market once they’re successful and probably undercut what US and European launch companies are doing.” The up-and-coming Chinese launchers include Space Pioneer’s reusable Tianlong-3 rocket and Cosmoleap’s Yueqian rocket. The latter is to feature a “chopstick clamp” recovery of the first stage, where it’s grabbed by the launch tower’s mechanical arms, similar to the concept SpaceX is testing for its Starship.\n\nGlitches and government\n\nBefore SpaceX’s rivals can really compete, they need to work out the kinks, demonstrate the reliability of their new spacecraft, and show that they can deliver low-cost launch services to customers. \n\nThe process is not without its challenges. Boeing’s Starliner delivered astronauts to the ISS on its first crewed flight in June 2024, but after thruster malfunctions, they were left stranded at the orbital outpost for nine months. While New Glenn reached orbit as planned, its first stage didn’t land successfully and its upper stage was left in orbit. \n\nSpaceX itself has had some recent struggles. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded the Falcon 9 more than once following malfunctions in the second half of 2024. The company still shattered records last year, though, with more than 130 Falcon 9 launches. It has continued with that record pace this year, despite additional Falcon 9 delays and more glitches with its booster and upper stage. SpaceX also conducted its eighth Starship test flight in March, just two months after the previous one, but both failed minutes after liftoff, raining debris down from the sky.\n\nAny company must deal with financial challenges as well as engineering ones. Boeing is reportedly considering selling parts of its space business, following Starliner’s malfunctions and problems with its 737 Max aircraft. And Virgin Orbit, the launch company that spun off from Virgin Galactic, shuttered in 2023.\n\nAnother issue facing would-be commercial competitors to SpaceX in the US is the complex and uncertain political environment. Musk does not manage day-to-day operations of the company. But he has close involvement with DOGE, a Trump administration initiative that has been exerting influence on the workforces and budgets of NASA, the Defense Department, and regulators relevant to the space industry. \n\nJared Isaacman, a billionaire who bankrolled the groundbreaking 2021 commercial mission Inspiration4, returned to orbit, again via a SpaceX craft, on Polaris Dawn last September. Now he may become Trump’s NASA chief, a position that could give him the power to nudge NASA toward awarding new lucrative contracts to SpaceX. In February it was reported that SpaceX’s Starlink might land a multibillion-dollar FAA contract previously awarded to Verizon. \n\nIt is also possible that SpaceX could strengthen its position with respect to the regulatory scrutiny it has faced for environmental and safety issues at its production and launch sites on the coasts of Texas and Florida, as well as scrutiny of its rocket crashes and the resulting space debris. Oversight from the FAA, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Environmental Protection Agency may be weak. Conflicts of interest have already emerged at the FAA, and the Trump administration has also attempted to incapacitate the National Labor Relations Board. SpaceX had previously tried to block the board from acting after nine workers accused the company of unfair labor practices.\n\nSpaceX did not respond to MIT Technology Review’s requests for comment for this story.\n\n“I think there’s going to be a lot of emphasis to relieve a lot of the regulations, in terms of environmental impact studies, and things like that,” Samson says. “I thought there’d be a separation between [Musk’s] interests, but now, it’s hard to say where he stops and the US government begins.”\n\nRegardless of the politics, the commercial competition will surely heat up throughout 2025. But SpaceX has a considerable head start, Bingen argues: “It’s going to take a lot for these companies to effectively compete and potentially dislodge SpaceX, given the dominant position that [it has] had.”\n\nRamin Skibba is an astrophysicist turned science writer and freelance journalist, based in the Bay Are",

In reality, software development is at a fork in the road: embracing the (currently) far-off notion of fully automated software development or acknowledging the work of a software developer is much more than just writing lines of code.\n\nThe decision the industry makes could have significant long-term consequences. Increasing complacency around AI-generated code and a shift to what has been termed “vibe coding” — where code is generated through natural language prompts until the results seem to work — will lead to code that’s more error-strewn, more expensive to run and harder to change in the future. And, if the devaluation of software development skills continues, we may even lack a workforce with the skills and knowledge to fix things down the line. \n\nThis means software developers are going to become more important to how the world builds and maintains software. Yes, there are many ways their practices will evolve thanks to AI coding assistance, but in a world of proliferating machine-generated code, developer judgment and experience will be vital.\n\nThe dangers of AI-generated code are already here\n\nThe risks of AI-generated code aren’t science fiction: they’re with us today. Research done by GitClear earlier this year indicates that with AI coding assistants (like GitHub Copilot) going mainstream, code churn — which GitClear defines as “changes that were either incomplete or erroneous when the author initially wrote, committed, and pushed them to the company’s git repo&#8221; — has significantly increased. GitClear also found there was a marked decrease in the number of lines of code that have been moved, a signal for refactored code (essentially the care and feeding to make it more effective).\n\nIn other words, from the time coding assistants were introduced there’s been a pronounced increase in lines of code without a commensurate increase in lines deleted, updated, or replaced. Simultaneously, there&#8217;s been a decrease in lines moved — indicating a lot of code has been written but not refactored. More code isn’t necessarily a good thing (sometimes quite the opposite); GitClear’s findings ultimately point to complacency and a lack of rigor about code quality.\n\nCan AI be removed from software development?\n\nHowever, AI doesn’t have to be removed from software development and delivery. On the contrary, there’s plenty to be excited about. As noted in the latest volume of the Technology Radar — Thoughtworks’ report on technologies and practices from work with hundreds of clients all over the world — the coding assistance space is full of opportunities. \n\nSpecifically, the report noted tools like Cursor, Cline and Windsurf can enable software engineering agents. What this looks like in practice is an agent-like feature inside developer environments that developers can ask specific sets of coding tasks to be performed in the form of a natural language prompt. This enables the human/machine partnership.\n\nThat being said, to only focus on code generation is to miss the variety of ways AI can help software developers. For example, Thoughtworks has been interested in how generative AI can be used to understand legacy codebases, and we see a lot of promise in tools like Unblocked, which is an AI team assistant that helps teams do just that. In fact, Anthropic’s Claude Code helped us add support for new languages in an internal tool, CodeConcise. We use CodeConcise to understand legacy systems; and while our success was mixed, we do think there’s real promise here.\n\nTightening practices to better leverage AI\n\nIt’s important to remember much of the work developers do isn’t developing something new from scratch. A large proportion of their work is evolving and adapting existing (and sometimes legacy) software. Sprawling and janky code bases that have taken on technical debt are, unfortunately, the norm. Simply applying AI will likely make things worse, not better, especially with approaches like vibe. \n\nThis is why developer judgment will become more critical than ever. In the latest edition of the Technology Radar report, AI-friendly code design is highlighted, based on our experience that AI coding assistants perform best with well-structured codebases. \n\nIn practice, this requires many different things, including clear and expressive naming to ensure context is clearly communicated (essential for code maintenance), reducing duplicate code, and ensuring modularity and effective abstractions. Done together, these will all help make code more legible to AI systems.\n\nGood coding practices are all too easy to overlook when productivity and effectiveness are measured purely in terms of output, and even though this was true before there was AI tooling, software development needs to focus on good coding first.\n\nAI assistance demands greater human responsibility\n\nInstagram co-founder Mike Krieger recently claimed that in three years software engineers won’t write any code: they will only review AI-created code. This might sound like a huge claim, but it’s important to remember that reviewing code has always been a major part of software development work. With this in mind, perhaps the evolution of software development won’t be as dramatic as some fear.\n\nBut there’s another argument: as AI becomes embedded in how we build software, software developers will take on more responsibility, not less. This is something we’ve discussed a lot at Thoughtworks: the job of verifying that an AI-built system is correct will fall to humans. Yes, verification itself might be AI-assisted, but it will be the role of the software developer to ensure confidence. \n\nIn a world where trust is becoming highly valuable — as evidenced by the emergence of the chief trust officer — the work of software developers is even more critical to the infrastructure of global industry. It’s vital software development is valued: the impact of thoughtless automation and pure vibes could prove incredibly problematic (and costly) in the years to come.\n\nThis content was produced by Thoughtworks.

    "title": "How 3D printing could make better cooling systems",
    "content": "A new 3D-printed design could make an integral part of cooling systems like air conditioners or refrigerators smaller and more efficient, according to new research. \n\nHeat exchangers are devices that whisk away heat, and they’re everywhere—used in data centers, ships, factories, and buildings. The aim is to pass as much heat as possible from one side of the device to the other. Most use one of a few standard designs that have historically been easiest and cheapest to make. \n\n“Heat exchangers are at the center of the industrial economy. They’re an essential part of every machine and every system that moves energy,” says William King, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and one of the authors of the new study. Existing designs tend to favor straight lines, right angles, and round tubes, he adds. \n\nKing and his colleagues used 3D printing to design a heat exchanger that includes features to optimize heat movement, like wavy walls and pyramid-shaped bumps, which wouldn’t be possible to make using traditional manufacturing techniques. \n\nThe team had set out to design a system based on a common refrigerant called R-134a, which is commonly used in devices like air conditioners and refrigerators. When cold water lowers the temperature of the refrigerant, it changes from a gas to a liquid on its path through the device. That liquid refrigerant can then go on to other parts of the cooling system, where it’s used to lower the temperature of anything from a room to a rack of servers. \n\nThe best way to cool the refrigerant tends to involve building very thin walls between the two sides of the device and maximizing the amount of contact that the water and the refrigerant make with those walls. (Think about how much colder you’d get wearing a thin T-shirt and pants and lying down on ice than simply touching it with your gloved hands.)\n\nTo design the best possible heat exchanger, researchers used simulations and developed machine-learning models to help predict the performance of different designs under different conditions. After 36,000 simulations, the researchers landed on the one they decided to develop.\n\nAmong the key components: small fins that jut out on the side of the device that touches the water, increasing the surface area to maximize heat transfer. The team also designed wavy passageways for the water to pass through—once again helping to maximize surface area. Simulations helped the researchers figure out exactly how curvy the passages should be and where precisely to place the fins.\n\nOn the side of the devices where the refrigerant passes through, the design includes small pyramid-shaped bumps along the walls. These not only maximize the area for cooling but also help mix the refrigerant as it passes through and prevent liquid from coating the wall (which would slow down the heat transfer).\n\nAfter settling on a design, the researchers used a 3D-printing technique called direct metal laser sintering, in which lasers melt and fuse together a metal powder (in this case, an aluminum alloy), layer by layer.\n\nIn testing, the researchers found that the heat exchanger created with this technique was able to cool down the refrigerant more efficiently than other designs. The new device was able to achieve a power density of over six megawatts per meter cubed—outperforming one common traditional design, the shell-tube configuration, by between 30% and 50% with the same pumping power. The device’s power density was similar to that of brazed plate heat exchangers, another common design in industry. \n\nOverall, this device doesn’t dramatically outperform the state-of-the-art technology, but the technique of using modeling and 3D printing to produce new heat exchanger designs is promising, says Dennis Nasuta, director of research and development at Optimized Thermal Systems, a consulting firm that works with companies in the HVAC industry on design and research. “It’s worth exploring, and I don’t think that we know yet where we can push it,” Nasuta says.\n\nOne challenge is that today, additive manufacturing techniques such as laser sintering are slow and expensive compared with traditional manufacturing; they wouldn’t be economical or feasible to rely on for all our consumer cooling devices, he says. For now, this type of approach could be most useful in niche applications like aerospace and high-end automotives, which could more likely bear the cost, he adds. \n\nThis particular study was funded by the US Office of Naval Research. Next-generation ships have more electronics aboard than ever, and there’s a growing need for compact and efficient systems to deal with all that extra heat, says Nenad Miljkovic, one of the authors of the study. \n\nEnergy demand for cooling buildings alone is set to double between now and 2050, and new designs could help efficiently meet the massive demand forecast for the coming decades. But challenges including manufacturing costs would need to be overcome to help innovations like the one designed by King and his team make a dent in real devices.\n\nAnother barrier to adopting these new techniques, Nasuta says, is that current standards don’t demand more efficiency. Other technologies already exist that could help make our devices more efficient, but they’re not used for the same reason. \n\nIt will take time for new manufacturing techniques, including 3D printing, to trickle into our devices, Natsua adds: “This isn’t going to be in your AC next year.”",

The software will also be sector-specific when it&#8217;s released more widely in the first quarter of next year. \n\nThe company first came together this past summer led by Petraeus, who joined the U.S. Reserve Officers&#8217; Training Corps to help defray the cost of her Ivy League education and wound up spending seven years in the U.S. Army, including as a civil affairs officer, before co-founding an online meals marketplace, then spending a year with McKinsey & Co. to get a better handle on how businesses are run. \n\nPetraeus says that across her experience, and particularly in the Army, she had &#8220;great leaders&#8221; who were &#8220;thoughtful about their [reports&#8217;] development goals and what was happening in their personal lives, and brought out the best in their people, rather than making them feel less than or marginalized.&#8221; \n\nStill, she was aware that from an institutional standpoint, most harassment training is not thoughtful, that it&#8217;s a matter of checking boxes on an annual basis to ensure compliance with different state laws, depending on where an organization is headquartered. She marveled that so much of the content employees are consuming seems &#8220;designed for a 1980s law firm.&#8221; \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nCasstime, a four-year-old, Shenzhen, China-based auto aftermarket procurement platform, has raised $80 million in Series C-1 funding co-led by Sequoia Capital China and Source Code Capital, with participation from earlier backer Hua Partners.

But I also knew from our own experience in struggling to raise money the need for more capital in Utah, and I thought having that operator-entrepreneur perspective could be useful.” \n\nA first fund, like many in the industry, was more of an experiment, though it was a decent $23 million, thanks largely to the support of Chegg CEO Dan Rosensweig, who was early to commit capital to the fund. A second ($56 million) fund followed when Krommenhoek and John Mayfield — a friend who joined him from a marketing role at Qualtrics — began investing more seriously in their backyard and beyond. \n\nThey were soon joined by a third investor, Diogo Myrrha, who began as a principal with the firm and is now a general partner. Explains Krommenhoek of one of the many things that binds the three Brigham Young University grads, “We all came into Utah’s orbit when it wasn’t necessarily a place where you could live out your career, but that’s changed.”\n\n More here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nArranta Bio, a months-old, Watertown, Ma.-based contract development manufacturing organization focused on the biotech industry, has raised $82 million in funding, including from Ampersand Capital Partners and Thermo Fisher. More here. \n\nB8ta, a four-year-old, San Francisco- and New York-based operator of an experiential retail-as-a-service platform, has raised $50 million in Series C funding led by Evolution Ventures, with participation from Macy’s, Khosla Ventures, and Peak State Ventures.

Then he really began to bounce around. Park worked as a trader in New York out of college, embraced the ski-bum life in Utah, then headed to Asia for Uber, where he spent six years, running its expansion team, then managing its entire Southeast Asia business out of Singapore. \n\nMore specifically, he was responsible for eight countries across the region, and 350 people, which didn’t give him a lot of time to organize his home. But he wasn’t overwhelmed by the chaos. Instead, he says that in Singapore, something unusual happened. “There’s this huge culture of landlords furnishing space to attract expats,” explains Park. “The furnishings aren’t super high-end, but they’re well-designed and well put together, and it enabled me to be basically moved in as soon as I put my clothes in the closet.” Suddenly, coming home was a treat — a new sensation for him. “For the first time, I was proud to host friends for dinners and barbecues and to just open the door and relax.” \n\nPark knew his U.S. friends could benefit from the same experience, and before long, he was talking with his Dartmouth classmate turned product and industrial designer Christian Talmage about forming their own company. Enter Oliver Space, which provides a lot of what that Singaporean landlord delivered to Park. It furnishes places for busy professionals, making moving into a new home as easy as hanging up their clothes. \n\nThe now year-old service is available in the Bay Area only. And Oliver Space employs just a dozen people so far. But the company has already gained enough traction to attract $6.8 million in seed funding from an interesting array of investors, including Mayfield, Abstract Ventures, investors Jana Messerschmidt and April Underwood, Opendoor founder Eric Wu, and Kevin and Julia Hartz of Eventbrite, among others. \n\nNow, Oliver Space just has to grow as quickly, or more so, than other furniture-as-service startups to recently attract funding. \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nGreensill, an eight-year-old, London-based provider of working capital and supply chain finance, has raised $655 million in new funding from earlier backer SoftBank Vision Fund.

Ad revenue rose to a record $33.9 billion, contributing to an overall profit of $7.1 billion, but that number, too, disappointed, given profits were 23 percent higher a year ago. The company cited the cost of new employees, but as the WSJ notes, Alphabet’s equity investments also seemingly played a role, with Alphabet reporting paper losses of $1.53 billion from such investments, compared with gains of $1.38 billion a year earlier.

Vance, who ran the first fund with Case, has stepped back, and longtime Revolution investor David Hall will manage the second fund instead. \n\nCertainly, that first fund kept its investors busy, with stakes in 125 companies. Barely a week passes without a startup announcing some funding from the Rise of the Rest team. \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nACV Auctions, a five-year-old, Buffalo, N.Y.-based online platform for franchise and used-car dealerships to buy and sell wholesale inventory through 20-minute auctions, is reportedly looking to raise $150 million in Series E funding at a post-money valuation north of $1 billion.

In a statement announcing the award, the Defense Department said: “The acquisition process was conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.” All parties “were treated fairly and evaluated consistently with the solicitation’s stated evaluation criteria,” said the statement. “We’re surprised about this conclusion,” Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said in a separate statement. “AWS is the clear leader in cloud computing, and a detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings clearly lead to a different conclusion.” The Washington Post has more here.\n\nSponsored By . . .\n\nGot funding?

Horowitz learned firsthand as a CEO how elusive it can be when he took stock of his company, only to discover it was made up of “screamers who intimidated their people,” others who “neglected to give any feedback,” and at least one compulsive liar who excelled at sucking up to Horowitz and also making up stories from whole cloth. \n\nHorowitz says creating culture was a missing part of his education, and in this new book — a follow-up to his best-selling “The Hard Thing About Hard Things” — he does his best to fill that gap for other CEOs, using his own experience, as well as lessons gleaned from historical figures Toussaint Louverture and Genghis Khan, along with Shaka Senghor, a contemporary who served time for murder and today is a criminal justice reform advocate. \n\nIt’s an instructive and novel combination, and we suggest picking up the book, especially if you love history. In the meantime, we sat down recently with Horowitz to talk about its timing and whether some of the biggest cultural blow-ups in the startup industry — Uber and WeWork — could have been avoided. These excerpts have been edited for length and clarity. Note that we’ll have more of the conversation — including Horowitz’s thoughts about dual-class shares — for readers of Extra Crunch on Monday. \n\nYou’ve just written a book about culture that’s coming out just as a lot of questions are being raised about culture because of WeWork. What happened there? \n\n[Cofounder Adam Neumann] had a certain kind of culture there. He had some holes — some great strengths and great holes. And sometimes that happens. When you’re really good at part of it, you can delude yourself into thinking that you’ve got everything you need when you have some massive incompleteness. \n\nAdam is so amazing. Like, the way they got all the money and everything. And the vision was so spectacular. And everybody there believed it, and they recruited some phenomenal talent. But when you’re that optimistic, it does help to have something in the culture that says [allows] people to bring you the bad news, like, if the accounting is all over the place or what have you. \n\nAs with Uber’s Travis Kalanick, whose culture also came under fire, Neumann operated in very plain sight. He wasn’t hiding who he was or what he was spending. \n\nRight, everybody knew how Travis was running the company. Everyone in Silicon Valley knew, let alone everyone on the board. The culture was published. You can look up Uber’s values [from that period]. \n\nTravis designed, I think, a really compelling culture, and believed in it, and published it. And the consequences of what he was missing were also super well-known. It’s only when board members think people are coming after them that [they take an interest in these things]. \n\nWhat are the biggest lessons in these two cases? \n\nI obviously know more about Uber [as a Lyft investor who follows the space]. In Uber’s case, it’s a very subtle thing. Travis had a really good code. But he had a bug in it. \n\nI think it was reported that, like, Travis encouraged bad behavior. I don’t think he did at all. I just think he didn’t make it clear that legal and ethical [considerations] were more important than competitiveness. As a result, when left to their own devices, in a distributed organization where there was a lot of distributed power, that combination had people doing things that were out of bounds. \n\nAnd he was making everybody so much money. And the company was growing so fast that, for the board members, I suspect they were like, ‘As long as it’s making money, I’m not going to worry about what happens next.’ \n\nTo me, the unfair part is, like, they shouldn’t get any credit at the end. Whatever you’re blaming Travis for [you should blame them, too] because they didn’t see it, either. I think that’s a charitable way of putting it. \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nFountain Medical, a 12-year-old, Beijing, China-based contract research organization for pharma, has raised $62 million in Series D funding led by Goldman Sachs, with participation from Lilly Asia Ventures.

There’s no more days needed to go fundraising. There’s no more days needed to go prove to the investor community that we’re a viable company. The size of the commitment that SoftBank has made to this company in the past and now is $18.5 billion. To put the things in context, that is bigger than the GDP of my country where I came from. That’s a country where there’s 11 million people.” \n\nClaure, a native of Bolivia who was named chairman as part of SoftBank’s rescue of the beleaguered co-working company, has been a SoftBank lieutenant for the last five years, and currently holds a variety of titles on its behalf, including COO of SoftBank Group Corp, CEO of SoftBank Group International and CEO of SoftBank Latin America. \n\nHe has said he first met SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son after building up his own business, Brightstar — a cellphone reseller — then selling 57% of it to SoftBank in 2013 in a deal that valued the company at $2.2 billion. SoftBank later acquired more of the company before deciding to explore a sale of the low-margin business last year for $1 billion. \n\nBy then, Claure was running Sprint, a SoftBank-backed property that installed Claure as CEO in 2014, where he presided over a massive share slide that began before he joined the company and ended only last year when T-Mobile and Sprint agreed to merge. \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nArcutis Biotherapeutics, a three-year-old, Westlake Village, Ca.-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that wants to commercialize treatments for immune-mediated dermatological diseases and conditions, has raised $94.5 million in Series C funding.

Over the years, we&#8217;ve mistakenly believed that a number of founders have obtained specific college degrees based on their LinkedIn bio, only to learn offline that they enrolled for some period of time in a particular program that they didn&#8217;t complete. \n\nIt happened most recently with the cofounder of a startup who one would might surmise based on his LinkedIn profile has a master&#8217;s degree from Harvard but does not. We also misunderstood the CEO of a robotics company to have a PhD based on her LinkedIn. It was our fault; it mentioned under the credit that she&#8217;d left to start a company. But anyone scanning the site might have come to the same wrong conclusion. (We pointed this out to her team, and mention of the PhD was deleted.) \n\nIn a higher-profile case, James Damore, the fired Google engineer who authored that infamous memo about the company&#8217;s diversity practices and whose LinkedIn page cited under &#8220;Education&#8221; a &#8220;PhD, Systems Biology,&#8221; removed mention of those doctoral studies after Wired confirmed with Harvard that he was enrolled in the program but didn&#8217;t complete the doctorate. \n\nDamore tried to defend his own LinkedIn profile, tweeting at the time, &#8220;I never told anyone I have a PhD. LinkedIn can&#8217;t distinguish between being in the PhD program and having a PhD (I forgot to update it).&#8221; \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nFabric, a four-year-old, New York-based startup that wants to make automated logistics available to retailers of all sizes, has raised $110 million in Series B funding.

Let&#8217;s talk.\n\nHave We Reached the Tipping Point?\n\nLimited partners or LPs &#8212; the pension funds, the university endowments, the family offices that largely provide venture firms with their spending money &#8212; are receiving a lot of attention from venture capitalists, some of it unwanted. VCs have begun knocking down their doors with requests for fresh capital commitments so they&#8217;ll have money to invest if the market cools down. \n\nThe problem is, many of these LPs are already over-allocated. LPs traditionally invest in many asset classes, such as public equities, and they allocate a small percentage of their portfolio to venture capital. Suddenly, they&#8217;re finding they&#8217;ve forked over more than they&#8217;d intended to VCs. \n\nThere are several reasons for this situation. First, VCs are returning to them ever faster for more capital &#8212; sometimes in less than two years&#8217; time &#8212; because they are in vesting at such a furious pace. \n\nCompounding the problem, not all LPs have received returns from their VC investments that they can recycle into new venture capital allocations. In some cases, this capital is still tied up in startups that are raising much more money than in the past and staying private longer. &#8220;We have some large exposures to blue chip names where IPOs have been rumored to be coming for a long time already, and now it&#8217;s maybe 2021, maybe 2022,&#8221; says one manager who asked not to be named. In other cases where startups have gone public, falling prices have prompted VCs to hang on to their shares instead of distribute them. \n\nThe result is that LPs are having to cut back on the number of managers they can fund, and that could mean bad news for venture capitalists and startups alike. These LPs don&#8217;t have much choice. As the LP explains it, &#8220;We have a pretty structured allocation process, and we&#8217;re really trying to be creative,&#8221; she says. One venture manager who reappeared too quickly for more money was &#8220;easy to walk away from,&#8221; says this person. &#8220;Others, we&#8217;re having to do financial backflips for them to remain strong partners.&#8221; Either way, this LP adds, &#8220;We can&#8217;t add any new relationships right now,&#8221; meaning new venture teams in particular are out of luck. &#8220;When [VCs] shorten their fundraising cycle by nine months to a year, you can only squeeze the balloon so much.&#8221; \n\nSoftBank&#8217;s $100 billion &#8220;Vision Fund&#8221; is one big reason LPs find themselves in their current predicament. From the moment SoftBank began waving money around several years ago, it launched a vicious cycle. According to Chris Douvos, whose investment firm, Ahoy Capital, owns stakes in such venture funds as True Ventures and First Round Capital, &#8220;When Andreessen Horowitz hit the scene a decade ago, they changed the tempo of investing and everyone got more aggressive in their dealmaking as a response. Then SoftBank entered the picture in a big way, and it was like a16z on steroids.&#8221; \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nBlueground, a six-year-old, New York-based startup providing turnkey flexible rental apartments, has raised $50 million in Series B funding, roughly six months after raising $20 million in Series A funding.

The way you’re acting is not how we built it,’” he said. \n\nThese may sound like more outlandish proclamations from Neumann, who has a flair for the dramatic. (Talking to Fast Company earlier this year, he compared WeWork to a rare jewel, asking, “Do you know how long it takes a diamond to be created?”) \n\nBut before WeWork began coming apart at the seams, Neumann had every reason to believe that he could pass power down to his heirs. \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings  \n\nArsenalBio, a year-old, South San Francisco-based biotech outfit that hopes to improve the ability of T cell therapies to better fight a broader range of cancers, has raised $85 million in Series A funding.

    "title": "Twitter User Claims TradingView Has Ignored a Fibonacci Retracement Bug for 5 Years",
    "content": "Update: the CTO of TradingView told Cointelegraph in comments that the reports of a bug were inaccurate, and the Twitter user partially withdrew his earlier claims that the tool was broken. Popular chart analysis service TradingView reportedly contains a bug in the Fibonacci retracement technical analysis tool, according to a tweet by self-proclaimed certified Elliott wave analyst Cryptoteddybear published on June 13. The Elliott wave principle is a type of technical analysis for predicting prices in financial markets by looking at recurring patterns. In a video that he uploaded to YouTube, the analyst explains that the tool does linear calculations when in logarithmic charts, which he notes is a significant issue for Elliot wave traders. The official Twitter account of the company behind the charting service answered his tweet, announcing that the issue is being investigated, to which Cryptoteddybear answered: &ldquo;Thank you @tradingview for finally taking this issue seriously.&rdquo; The first reports of the bug, posted over five years ago (in November 2014) on consumer community platform getsatisfaction, have been reportedly ignored by the company. Another report submitted on the same platform, dated June 3, 2017, has seen the official TradingView account answer in the thread: &ldquo;Hi, you are right, we have a planned task to fix this. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.&rdquo; However, the problem apparently has not yet been solved. Cryptoteddybear claims that a company representative told him that he asked the technicians to increase the priority given to solving the bug. As Cointelegraph recently reported, TradingView is one of the platforms that added the &ldquo;CIX100&rdquo; index &mdash; an AI-powered index for the 100 strongest-performing cryptocurrencies and tokens. At the beginning of the current month, cryptocurrency analytics company Coin Metrics announced that it has acquired digital asset index firm Bletchley Indexes and plans to launch crypto smart beta indexes. As of press time, TradingView has not responded to a request for comment.",
