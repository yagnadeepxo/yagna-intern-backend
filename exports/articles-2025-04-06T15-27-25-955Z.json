However, prolonged consumption of such foods may reduce their hedonic value, potentially contributing to obesity2,3,4. Here we investigated this phenomenon in mice on a chronic high-fat diet (HFD). Although these mice preferred high-fat food over regular chow in their home cages, they showed reduced interest in calorie-rich foods in a no-effort setting. This paradoxical decrease in hedonic feeding has been reported previously3,4,5,6,7, but its neurobiological basis remains unclear. We found that in mice on regular diet, neurons in the lateral nucleus accumbens (NAcLat) projecting to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) encoded hedonic feeding behaviours. In HFD mice, this behaviour was reduced and uncoupled from neural activity. Optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway increased hedonic feeding in mice on regular diet but not in HFD mice, though this behaviour was restored when HFD mice returned to a regular diet. HFD mice exhibited reduced neurotensin expression and release in the NAcLat→VTA pathway. Furthermore, neurotensin knockout in the NAcLat and neurotensin receptor blockade in the VTA each abolished optogenetically induced hedonic feeding behaviour. Enhancing neurotensin signalling via overexpression normalized aspects of diet-induced obesity, including weight gain and hedonic feeding. Together, our findings identify a neural circuit mechanism that links the devaluation of hedonic foods with obesity.\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nInput-specific modulation of murine nucleus accumbens differentially regulates hedonic feeding\nArticle Open access 09 April 2021\nNesfatin-1 decreases the motivational and rewarding value of food\nArticle Open access 30 April 2020\nNeurotensin neurons in the extended amygdala control dietary choice and energy homeostasis\nArticle 20 October 2022\nMain\n\nExcessive consumption of high-calorie foods is a key contributor to the development and progression of obesity in humans and animals8,9. Chronic exposure to a HFD profoundly influences eating behaviours, particularly those driven by the pleasurable (that is, hedonic) properties of food10. To investigate how a chronic HFD affects these behaviours, we placed C57Bl/6 mice on a chronic HFD. Although these mice consistently preferred high-fat chow over standard chow in their home cages (Fig. 1a–c), they paradoxically exhibited a reduced drive to opportunistically consume high-calorie foods in an acute feeding assay, even when no effort was required to obtain the food (Fig. 1d). One possible explanation is that chronic HFD exposure leads to a reduction in the hedonic value of high-calorie foods, decreasing their pleasurable or rewarding aspects.\n\nFig. 1: Chronic HFD promotes uncoupling of NAcLat→VTA activity during hedonic feeding.\n\na, Body weight of REG mice that are switched to HFD and then returned to REG.

Data are mean ± s.e.m. (error bars or shading).\n\nSource Data\n\nFull size image\n\nThe mesolimbic dopamine system, consisting of dopamine-producing cells in the VTA projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), has been implicated in the motivational aspects of feeding behaviour11,12,13, although other dopaminergic projections are also likely to be involved14. Activation of VTA dopamine neurons projecting to the NAc is associated with the rewarding aspects of food consumption15. Anticipation of food or liquid rewards enhances dopamine neuron firing, promoting goal-directed behaviours15,16,17,18. Conversely, chronic HFD exposure has been shown to reduce dopamine activity in both mice and humans2,19,20,21,22,23,24, potentially impairing reward-related processes and contributing to obesity.\n\nAlthough much research has focused on the role of dopamine neurons in feeding and obesity, less is known about the effects of chronic HFD on inhibitory projections from the NAc to the VTA. The NAc provides substantial GABAergic input to the VTA, directly and indirectly influencing dopamine neurons25,26. We previously demonstrated that optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway induces robust reward-related behaviours, such as place preference and intracranial self-stimulation, possibly via disinhibition of dopamine neurons26. However, whether increased neural activity in this pathway is associated with hedonic feeding behaviours and how it is affected by diet-induced obesity remain unclear.\n\nChronic HFD disrupts NAcLat→VTA activity\n\nTo study the effects of chronic HFD on NAcLat→VTA activity during feeding behaviours, we first injected C57Bl6 mice with a retrogradely transported virus carrying Cre recombinase (pseudotyped equine infectious anaemia virus, RG-EIAV-Cre) into the lateral VTA and a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying ChR2 into the NAcLat. The mice were also implanted with a custom-made drivable optoelectrode (optrode) above the NAcLat (Fig. 1e). In these mice, ChR2 expression was largely restricted to the NAcLat and not observed in the NAc core or NAc medial shell (Extended Data Fig. 1a–d). Two weeks after stereotaxic surgery, mice were randomly split into two cohorts, with one cohort remaining on a regular diet (REG mice; 4% fat, standard mouse chow) and the other being placed on a HFD where both regular (4% fat) and high-fat chow (60% fat) were freely available in the home cage. HFD mice rapidly gained weight when compared with REG mice (Extended Data Fig. 1e). After 30 days of diet, we recorded the neural activity of opto-tagged NAcLat→VTA cells (examples of opto-tagging in units from REG and HFD mice are shown in Extended Data Fig. 1i–r) during free exploration of an open-field chamber containing calorie-rich (jelly) and low-calorie (chow) foods (Fig. 1f,g). The behaviour of REG and HFD mice was recorded on video and analysed using DeepLabCut (DLC) to identify discrete behavioural motifs (Extended Data Fig. 1f), which included actions such as feeding, touching an empty food cup, rearing, turning and various forms of locomotion at different velocities (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h). A piezo sensor placed under the food cup was used to detect precise feeding event timestamps, which showed a strong correlation with DLC-detected feeding events (Extended Data Fig. 2a–d). Food consumption was measured by weighing the food cups after each session. As expected, REG mice consumed significantly more jelly than chow, whereas HFD mice consumed less jelly overall (Fig. 1h). To analyse neural activity, we quantified unit firing rates before and during the onset of each behavioural motif and classified responses as unchanged (non-responsive), significantly increased (IR type) or significantly decreased (DR type) (Fig. 1i–k). No significant differences were observed in the average time spent in each DLC-detected motif between REG and HFD mice (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Of note, firing rates were negatively correlated with total time spent in each motif, with higher firing rates during motifs with less time spent (for example, jelly and chow feeding or touching the empty cup) and lower firing rates during longer-duration motifs such as locomotion (Extended Data Fig. 2f). Next, we assessed the proportions of classified response types in REG and HFD mice to determine whether they differed between diets. In REG mice, opto-tagged units showed high firing rates during jelly consumption, with the majority of units exhibiting significantly increased responses, whereas other behavioural motifs frequently showed decreased responses. By contrast, opto-tagged units in HFD mice displayed lower firing rates during jelly consumption, with none of the tagged units reaching statistical significance (Fig. 1l,m). Similar results were observed in piezo-based analyses, with increased firing rates during jelly consumption in REG mice and a marked reduction in HFD mice (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Non-tagged units also exhibited higher firing rates during jelly consumption compared to other motifs as well as reduced proportions of IR responses in HFD mice compared with REG mice for both DLC- and piezo-based analyses, although the effect size was smaller (Extended Data Fig. 2g–j). Together, these results suggest that increased activity of NAcLat→VTA cells is associated with hedonic feeding, but chronic HFD disrupts this relationship.\n\nDiet-dependent control of hedonic feeding\n\nNext, we examined whether increased activity in the NAcLat→VTA pathway is sufficient to induce feeding behaviour. We injected AAV-hSyn-ChR2 or AAV-hSyn-eYFP into the NAcLat of C57Bl6 mice and implanted an optical fibre above the VTA (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Figs. 3a,b and 4a,b). Mice were subjected to REG or HFD for four weeks. We then analysed the consumption of different food types (one food type per day) without and with optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway. On each experimental day, mice were subjected to habituation and a primed-feeding trial (15 min each; laser off), which were followed by 3 additional trials (15 min each: laser off, laser on (473 nm, 20 Hz), laser off). Mice had free access to each food type during all trials, except the habituation trial, when no food was present (Fig. 2b,c). Although mice could consume each food type to satiating levels already during the primed-feeding trial, we noticed that in this trial, HFD mice showed significantly reduced consumption of high-calorie foods when compared to REG mice (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Even though feeding levels were low after the primed-feeding trial, high-frequency optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway in REG mice resulted in significantly increased consumption of high-calorie foods (jelly, chocolate, peanut butter, butter and high-fat chow). By contrast, optogenetic stimulation of NAcLat→VTA did not change the consumption of low-calorie foods (regular chow) or water (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3d), including when the same mice were tested after 24 h of food deprivation (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f). Additionally, stimulating NAcLat→VTA did not modify the feeding of quinine-adulterated butter that holds similar calorie value as butter but with reduced palatability (Extended Data Fig. 3g,h). The mean weights of ChR2 and eYFP REG mice did not differ before and after the series of feeding experiments, indicating that the feeding behaviour in this assay did not affect overall weight gain (Extended Data Fig. 3i). We performed several additional experiments in separate cohorts of REG mice to further examine the effects of manipulating the NAcLat→VTA pathway on hedonic feeding behaviour. First, we applied optogenetic stimulation in an acute feeding assay (equivalent to primed-feeding trial) and found that this was sufficient to increase jelly consumption in ChR2 but not eYFP mice (Extended Data Fig. 3j). Second, to examine whether optogenetic activation of NAcLat cell bodies affects hedonic food consumption, mice were injected with ChR2 into the NAcLat and implanted with two optical fibres (one each above the VTA and NAcLat). In these mice, light stimulation of the VTA, but not NAcLat, increased jelly consumption (Extended Data Fig. 3k–n), suggesting that projection specificity is necessary for inducing hedonic feeding behaviour. Third, we optogenetically silenced the NAcLat→VTA pathway and assessed jelly consumption during the primed-feeding trial on separate days with and without laser stimulation. Optogenetic inhibition significantly reduced hedonic feeding behaviour (Extended Data Fig. 3o–t).\n\nFig. 2: Opto-stimulation of NAcLat→VTA promotes hedonic feeding in REG mice but not in HFD mice.\n\na, Experimental design. b, Acute feeding assay: mice were placed in an open-field chamber containing two cups (one with food and one empty). c, Timeline: mice were tested in 5× 15-min trials. Food was presented during trials 2 to 5, with laser stimulation (473 nm, 20 Hz, 5 ms) during trial 4. After each trial, the food cup was replaced with a new cup of the same food type, and consumption was analysed. d, Consumption during the acute feeding assay for ChR2 and eYFP mice on a REG diet (jelly (ChR2: n = 10 mice, eYFP: n = 8 mice; ***P = 0.0001), chocolate (ChR2: n = 10 mice, eYFP: n = 9 mice; ***P = 0.0003), peanut butter (ChR2: n = 10 mice, eYFP: n = 9 mice; *P = 0.0112), butter (ChR2: n = 10 mice, eYFP: n = 9 mice; *P = 0.0201), high-fat chow (ChR2: n = 9 mice, eYFP: n = 9 mice; **P = 0.0032), chow (ChR2: n = 10 mice, eYFP: n = 9 mice; P > 0.05) or water (ChR2: n = 7 mice, eYFP: n = 9 mice; P > 0.05)). Blue indicates laser stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway (2-way repeated measures ANOVA with Holm–Šídák test). e, Food consumption during the acute feeding assay for HFD mice (P > 0.05; ChR2: n = 10 mice, eYFP: n = 5 mice, 2-way repeated measures ANOVA with Holm–Šídák test). f, Real-time place preference: HFD mice received NAcLat→VTA stimulation (473 nm, 20 Hz, 5 ms pulses) upon entry into one compartment of a 3-chamber apparatus. The paired side was switched after 10 min. Sample trajectories show movement during each phase. HFD mice spent significantly more time in the light-paired compartment (stim) compared to the unpaired compartment (non-stim) (***P < 0.001, 2-sided paired Student’s t-test; n = 18 mice). g, Food consumption during the acute feeding assay for mice removed from HFD and returned to a regular diet, tested at different time points (2 weeks off HFD: **P = 0.0075, 3 weeks off HFD: **P = 0.0041, 2-way repeated measures ANOVA with Holm–Šídák test; ChR2: n = 8 mice, eYFP: n = 7 mice). Data are mean ± s.e.m.\n\nSource Data\n\nFull size image\n\nIn HFD mice, 20 Hz optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway did not promote hedonic or non-hedonic feeding behaviour (Fig. 2e), even when mice were tested after 24 h of food deprivation (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). Despite the loss of opto-induced feeding behaviour, optogenetic stimulation still induced place preference in these HFD mice (Fig. 2f). However, the effect of HFD was reversible, as the levels of food consumed during both primed-feeding trial (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f) and optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway (Fig. 2g) were gradually restored when HFD mice were placed back on a regular diet for at least two weeks, suggesting normalization of hedonic feeding behaviour to similar levels as REG mice. Together, stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway increased hedonic feeding in REG mice but not in HFD mice—the response was restored when HFD mice were returned to a regular diet.\n\nHFD reduces neurotensin signalling\n\nTo investigate the cellular and molecular adaptations triggered by chronic HFD, we used single-cell patch sequencing of NAcLat→VTA cells (Fig. 3a). REG and HFD mice were injected with fluorescent retrobeads into the VTA. One week later, we measured the intrinsic membrane properties and responses to current injections with whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of bead-labelled NAcLat cells before extracting cell cytosol for RNA sequencing. Although the firing rate in response to depolarizing current injections was slightly increased in HFD mice, the comparison did not reach statistical significance, and we also found no differences in the intrinsic membrane properties of NAcLat→VTA neurons in REG and HFD mice (Fig. 3b–f).\n\nFig. 3: Reduced NAcLat → VTA NTS expression and release in HFD mice.\n\na, Patch-seq experimental design. b, Example current injection (150 pA) in bead-labelled NAcLat→VTA cells from REG (top) and HFD (bottom) mice. c–f, Electrophysiological properties of NAcLat→VTA cells from REG and HFD mice. c, Firing frequency (P > 0.05, 2-way repeated measures ANOVA; REG: n = 23 cells, n = 10 mice; HFD: n = 19 cells, n = 11 mice). d, Membrane capacitance (P > 0.05, unpaired Student’s t-test; REG: n = 21 cells, n = 10 mice; HFD: n = 20 cells, n = 11 mice). e, Membrane resistance (P > 0.05, unpaired Student’s t-test; REG: n = 21 cells, n = 10 mice; HFD: n = 20 cells, n = 11 mice). f, Resting membrane potential (P > 0.05, 2-sided unpaired Student’s t-test; REG: n = 23 cells, n = 10 mice; HFD: n = 20 cells, n = 11 mice). g, Volcano plot of differential gene expression in NAcLat→VTA cells between REG and HFD mice.

Data are mean ± s.e.m. (error bars or shading).\n\nSource Data\n\nFull size image\n\nWe next evaluated diet-induced transcriptomic differences of more than 8,000 genes, and found that 280 genes were downregulated (P < 0.05, log-transformed fold change (log2FC) <−1) and 183 genes were upregulated (P < 0.05, log2FC > 1) (Extended Data Fig. 5a–e). As expected, NAcLat→VTA cells expressed marker genes for GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-expressing) neurons and Drd1 mRNA, whereas glutamatergic marker genes and Drd2 mRNA were detected less frequently. Expression of these genes did not change in response to HFD (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). When focusing our analysis on genes that have been associated with synaptic signalling as well as feeding behaviour, we found that Nts (encoding neurotensin, a neuropeptide involved in feeding behaviour27,28,29) was strongly expressed in NAcLat→VTA cells compared with other members of these gene families (the median expression of Nts was in the 98th percentile of observations from 587 genes). Nts was detected in 95% of NAcLat→VTA cells obtained from REG mice and in 90% of the cells obtained from HFD mice (Extended Data Fig. 5f). The overlap between Nts expression and projection target was also confirmed by additional retrograde tracing experiments in which cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) was injected into the VTA of NTS-Cre mice crossed to an Ai14 reporter mouse line. We found that approximately 75% of the CTB-labelled cells also express Nts (Extended Data Fig. 5g,h), further confirming that NTS is enriched in the NAcLat→VTA pathway. However, it is possible that NTS-expressing NAcLat neurons also project to other brain structures.\n\nTranscriptomic difference analysis revealed that in HFD mice, Nts expression levels were reduced compared with REG mice (log2FC = −1.52) (Fig. 3g–j). This reduction in Nts expression following HFD was further confirmed using in situ hybridization in a separate cohort of mice. Of note, Nts expression levels seemed to recover if HFD mice were returned to a regular diet for three weeks (Extended Data Fig. 5i–m).\n\nWe next sought to determine whether diet-induced reduction in Nts mRNA expression results in measurable changes in NTS release. To do this, we utilized a novel GPCR fluorescent sensor, ntsLight1.1, whose structure mimics the neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) and increases fluorescence when NTS is bound. We validated the sensitivity and specificity of ntsLight1.1 for NTS in both cultured neurons and ex vivo brain-slice preparations (Extended Data Fig. 6a–f). To test whether NTS release is reduced in HFD mice, we injected ntsLight1.1 into the VTA and AAV-hSyn-ChrimsonR-tdTomato (Chrimson) into the NAcLat of mice placed on REG or HFD for 6 weeks. We recorded ntsLight1.1 in VTA slices and found that optogenetic stimulation of NAcLat terminals resulted in significantly less ntsLight1.1 fluorescence in HFD mice compared with REG mice (Fig. 3k–m and Extended Data Fig. 6g,h), indicating that NTS release is reduced in HFD mice ex vivo. Although ntsLight1.1 provided robust readouts in brain-slice recordings, its sensitivity was limited for reliably detecting signals in vivo. To address this, we developed ntsLight2.0, which exhibited enhanced sensitivity, making it more effective for in vivo applications (Extended Data Fig. 7a–x). We injected ntsLight2.0 into the VTA and Chrimson into the NAcLat, implanting optical fibres above the NAcLat and in the VTA. Four weeks later, we recorded ntsLight2.0 signals in the VTA using fibre photometry in head-fixed mice during optogenetic stimulation of NAcLat cells. Stimulation produced bidirectional ntsLight2.0 transients in the VTA composed of a fast negative peak that occurred during laser stimulation (0–2 s) followed by a slower positive peak (3–5 s). The slower positive, but not the fast negative peak, was blocked by intraperitoneal injection of an NTSR1 antagonist (SR48692, 5 mg kg−1; Extended Data Fig. 7q–u), suggesting that laser stimulation produces a brief artefact that is followed by an increase of NTS release. Notably, after mice were on a HFD for 4 weeks, the increase in ntsLight2.0 signals triggered by NAcLat stimulation was significantly reduced only in the 3–5 s interval (Fig. 3n–p and Extended Data Fig. 7y–ab). Together, these experiments suggest that HFD reduces NTS expression and release in the NAcLat→VTA pathway.\n\nNTS is necessary for hedonic feeding\n\nTo test whether optogenetic stimulation of NTS-expressing NAcLat neurons is sufficient for inducing hedonic feeding behaviour, we expressed Cre-dependent ChR2 in NAcLat neurons of NTS-Cre mice and implanted an optical fibre above the VTA of mice kept on a regular diet. Optogenetic stimulation of NAcLat terminals in the VTA in an acute feeding assay (same as in Fig. 2) increased hedonic feeding without affecting general locomotor activity (Extended Data Fig. 8a–f).\n\nNext, we sought to determine whether NTS expression in the NAcLat is necessary for inducing hedonic feeding behaviour. We performed a conditional knockout of NTS in NAcLat neurons by injecting AAV-hSyn-Cre into the NAcLat of Ntsflox mice kept on a regular diet. These mice were also injected with AAV-hSyn-ChR2 into the NAcLat, and an optical fibre was implanted above the VTA. Control mice were treated identically but did not receive AAV-hSyn-Cre injection (Fig. 4a). In situ hybridization experiments, performed in a separate cohort of mice, confirmed a significant reduction of NTS expression in the NAcLat of Nts-knockout mice compared with control mice (Fig. 4b,c). We then optogenetically stimulated NAcLat terminals in the VTA in the acute feeding assay. As expected, control mice showed increased jelly consumption. However, in Nts-knockout mice, optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway did not increase hedonic feeding, indicating that NTS expression in the NAcLat is necessary for this behaviour (Fig. 4d,e and Extended Data Fig. 8g).\n\nFig. 4: NAcLat→VTA NTS is necessary for hedonic feeding and dopamine cell excitation.\n\na, AAV-hSyn-ChR2 was injected alone (Nts-ctrl) or with AAV-hSyn-Cre (Nts-KO) into NAcLat of Ntsflox mice, with an optical fibre above VTA in REG mice. b, Fluorescent in situ hybridization images in NAcLat of Nts-ctrl and Nts-KO mice.

Data are mean ± s.e.m.\n\nSource Data\n\nFull size image\n\nFinally, to test whether NTS receptor activation in the VTA is necessary for hedonic feeding behaviour, we implanted an infusion cannula with an optical fibre above the VTA of mice expressing ChR2 or eYFP in the NAcLat (Fig. 4f,g and Extended Data Fig. 8i,j). We then assessed jelly consumption in the acute feeding assay with the addition of infusions of an NTS receptor antagonist (SR142948A, 6 mM) or saline into the VTA before optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway (Fig. 4h). As expected, we found that following saline infusion, optogenetic stimulation of NAcLat→VTA increased jelly consumption in ChR2-expressing but not eYFP-expressing mice. By contrast, intra-VTA infusion of SR142948A prevented the increase in jelly consumption in response to NAcLat→VTA stimulation (Fig. 4i and Extended Data Fig. 8h), suggesting that functional NTS receptors are necessary for optogenetic-induced hedonic feeding behaviour.\n\nHFD reduces excitation of dopamine neurons\n\nPrevious studies have shown that NAcLat neurons synapse onto local VTA GABAergic neurons and potentially disinhibit dopamine neurons to promote reward-related behaviours26. However, in addition to disinhibition, VTA dopamine neurons may also be directly excited through NTS binding to NTSR1 following its release from NAcLat terminals, as demonstrated for NTS inputs from the lateral hypothalamus to VTA30,31—a circuit that is known to have a critical role in the regulation of feeding behaviour and obesity32,33. To test this possibility, we performed brain-slice patch-clamp recordings of NAcLat-projecting dopamine neurons and optogenetically stimulated ChR2-expressing NAcLat terminals in the VTA (Fig. 4j,k). Consistent with previous studies26, we found that the firing rate of these cells increased during light stimulation. However, when VTA slices were bathed in solution containing an NTS receptor antagonist (SR142948A, 1 µM), the firing rate did not increase, suggesting that excitation of dopamine neurons following stimulation of NAcLat inputs involves binding of NTS to its receptor. Notably, in mice subjected to 4 weeks of HFD, optogenetic-induced excitation of dopamine neurons was already absent in the saline condition (Fig. 4l,m).\n\nNo postsynaptic changes following HFD\n\nIt is possible that chronic HFD disrupts NTS signalling in the NAcLat→VTA pathway not only pre-synaptically, but also post-synaptically. However, additional experiments suggest that postsynaptic mechanisms are unlikely. First, bath application of NTS in brain-slice perforated-patch recordings increased firing of VTA dopamine neurons in both REG and HFD mice (Extended Data Fig. 9a–c). Conversely, the firing rate of VTA GABA neurons remained unaffected by NTS application (Extended Data Fig. 9d–f), which is consistent with previous studies suggesting that these cells lack NTSR130,34. Second, we found no significant difference between REG mice and HFD mice in the expression of Ntsr1 mRNA in VTA dopamine neurons (Extended Data Fig. 9g–i). Third, we found no significant differences in the intrinsic excitability and membrane properties of NAcLat-projecting dopamine neurons (Extended Data Fig. 9j–q). Thus, HFD-induced changes in NTS function are likely to occur pre-synaptically and involve downregulation of NTS expression and release, while NTS receptors remain functional.\n\nEnhancing NTS restores hedonic feeding\n\nWe argued that enhancing NTS release could alleviate the observed changes in hedonic feeding behaviour following chronic HFD and potentially affect other metrics that shape obesity progression such as home cage feeding8, weight gain35 and mobility36. To increase NTS expression in HFD mice, we developed a Cre-dependent virus to overexpress NTS (ssAAV-9/2-shortCAG-dlox-mNts(rev)-dlox-WPRE-SV40p(A) (AAV-NTS-OE)). We injected this virus bilaterally into the NAcLat together with RG-EIAV-Cre into the VTA to drive Nts mRNA overexpression only in NAcLat cells that project to the VTA. To assess NTS overexpression, we detected Nts mRNA using fluorescent in situ hybridization and observed increased Nts expression in the NAcLat of HFD mice injected with AAV-NTS-OE (NTS-OE mice) compared with mice injected with a control virus encoding mCherry (Extended Data Fig. 10a–c). To confirm whether AAV-NTS-OE also increased NTS release in HFD mice, we injected ntsLight1.1 into the VTA and Chrimson into the NAcLat of mice on HFD in combination with AAV-NTS-OE or AAV-mCherry. We observed greater NTS release in HFD mice injected with AAV-NTS-OE compared with those injected with AAV-mCherry in response to optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway (Fig. 5a–c and Extended Data Fig. 10d).\n\nFig. 5: NTS overexpression in NAcLat→VTA mitigates HFD-induced behavioural adaptations.\n\na, A retrograde virus (RG-EIAV-Cre) was injected into the VTA, and either Cre-dependent AAV for NTS overexpression (NTS-OE) or mCherry (ctrl) was injected into the NAcLat of HFD mice. AAV-hSyn-Chrimson-tdTomato and AAV9-hSyn-ntsLight1.1 were also injected, and acute VTA slices were prepared six weeks later to record ntsLight1.1. b, ntsLight1.1 activity during opto-stimulation of NAcLat inputs in NTS-OE and mCherry mice on HFD. c, AUC of ntsLight1.1 activity shows significantly higher NTS release in NTS-OE mice (*P = 0.0397, 2-sided unpaired Student’s t-test; REG: n = 10 slices from n = 2 mice; HFD: n = 9 slices from n = 2 mice). d, Experimental design and timeline. e, Jelly consumption for NTS-OE and mCherry HFD mice with opto-stimulation of NAcLat→VTA (*P = 0.0309, 2-way repeated measures ANOVA with Holm–Šídák multiple comparisons test; NTS-OE: n = 6 mice, nCherry: n = 8 mice). f, Experimental design. g, Body weight in NTS-OE and mCherry mice on REG, HFD, and when returned to REG.

Data are mean ± s.e.m. (error bars or shading).\n\nSource Data\n\nFull size image\n\nNext, we sought to determine whether NTS overexpression could rescue the HFD-induced loss of hedonic feeding behaviour in response to optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway. To do this, we injected AAV-hSyn-ChR2 into the NAcLat and implanted an optical fibre above the VTA in a separate cohort of HFD mice injected with AAV-NTS-OE or AAV-mCherry (Fig. 5d). We found that HFD NTS-OE mice consumed significantly more jelly during the primed-feeding trial compared to HFD AAV-mCherry mice (Extended Data Fig. 10e). Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway increased jelly consumption in HFD NTS-OE mice but not in HFD AAV-mCherry mice (Fig. 5e).\n\nTo investigate whether NTS overexpression affects other aspects of diet-induced obesity, we subjected additional cohorts of NTS-overexpressing and mCherry control mice to a regular diet for 28 days. During this period, the body weight of NTS-overexpressing and mCherry mice remained similar. However, when switched to an HFD, the control mice rapidly gained weight, whereas NTS-overexpressing mice gained significantly less weight—a difference that normalized when the mice were returned to a regular diet (Fig. 5f,g). The effects of NTS overexpression on weight gain were robust and reproducible, as confirmed in two independent cohorts of mice under varying experimental conditions (baseline body weight, housing scheme and virus expression time) (Extended Data Fig. 10f). Additionally, we assessed jelly consumption in the acute feeding assay at different time points: on a regular diet, during HFD exposure (after 1 and 4 weeks on HFD), and after returning to a regular diet (OFF HFD, after 1 and 3 weeks on REG). NTS-overexpressing mice consumed significantly more jelly than mCherry controls starting from the first week of HFD, with this effect persisting for a week after returning to a regular diet (Fig. 5h). These findings suggest that NTS overexpression may attenuate the reduction in the hedonic value of high-calorie foods typically observed after HFD exposure. To further understand the behavioural changes contributing to reduced weight gain on HFD, we examined weekly consumption of chow and high-fat chow. We found that home cage consumption of high-fat chow was significantly reduced in NTS-overexpressing mice compared with mCherry mice after four weeks on HFD, whereas chow consumption remained unchanged at all time points (Fig. 5i).\n\nWe also analysed the body temperature and open-field behaviour of NTS-overexpressing and mCherry mice. Whereas body temperature did not differ between the two groups (Extended Data Fig. 10g), DLC-based behavioural motif analysis revealed that NTS-overexpressing mice spent more time in high-velocity motifs (such as fast walking and running) and exhibited increased locomotor activity (Fig. 5j–l and Extended Data Fig. 10i,j). Additionally, NTS-overexpressing mice spent more time in the centre of the open-field chamber, which may reflect reduced anxiety-related behaviours, as increased anxiety is often associated with diet-induced obesity37 (Extended Data Fig. 10k). Together, our results demonstrate that selective overexpression of NTS in the NAcLat→VTA pathway can restore NTS signalling to normalize multiple aspects of diet-induced obesity, including weight gain, hedonic feeding behaviour and locomotor activity.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe increased availability of high-calorie foods has been closely linked to the rising prevalence of obesity9, prompting the critical question of how continuous access to calorie-rich foods affects neural circuits involved in feeding and motivation. Here, we demonstrate that chronic HFD consumption alters hedonic feeding behaviours and disrupts signalling in the NAcLat→VTA pathway, specifically involving the neuropeptide NTS, influencing the progression of obesity.\n\nNTS signalling in hedonic feeding\n\nOur finding that NTS release from NAcLat neurons decreases after chronic HFD provides a circuit-level explanation for the link between dopamine activity and weight gain, altered feeding behaviour and obesity progression2,19,20,21,22,23,24. NTS acts through NTSR1 to enhance VTA dopamine neuron activation and increase dopamine release in the NAc30,31, where dopamine is a key regulator of reward learning and motivated behaviour15,38. Thus, HFD-induced reductions in NTS release from NAcLat terminals are likely to diminish dopamine excitation, reducing the desire to consume high-calorie foods.\n\nIn addition to NTS-induced excitation, dopaminergic cells in the VTA are activated via disinhibition mediated by VTA GABAergic neurons targeted by NAcLat inputs26. Our findings align with recent studies on lateral hypothalamus inputs to the VTA31, suggesting that NTS-induced excitation and disinhibition are both essential components of the in vivo function of this circuit.\n\nStimulation of NTS-expressing neurons in the NAcLat→VTA pathway and in other regions, such as the central and extended amygdala, promotes hedonic food and liquid consumption29,39. However, in brain regions such as the lateral septum40, hypothalamus41 and nucleus of the solitary tract42, NTS-expressing neurons suppress feeding behaviour. Moreover, direct infusion of NTS into the VTA has been shown to suppress feeding in food-deprived mice43. Several factors may explain these contrasting effects of NTS on feeding: (1) different sources of NTS innervation may target distinct subpopulations of VTA neurons, leading to variable behavioural outcomes. For example, NTS from the lateral hypothalamus has anorectic effects30. (2) NTS may bind to NTSR2, altering intracellular calcium levels in astrocytes44 and indirectly modulating dopamine signalling. (3) The activation of signalling cascades by NTSR1 exhibits variability depending on the specific molecules involved. This diversity in signalling cascades is based on the ability of NTSR1 to interact with distinct G proteins and recruit different intracellular effectors45, which could produce varying effects on feeding. (4) Excessive NTS levels could desensitize NTSR146, reversing its typical effects.\n\nWhile our results highlight the critical role of NTS in hedonic feeding, further work is needed to clarify how NTS release from different sources is integrated in the VTA to modulate feeding behaviours.\n\nDevaluation of high-calorie foods\n\nWe show that chronic HFD exposure leads to substantial alterations in hedonic feeding behaviour. Previous studies have reported reduced consumption of high-calorie liquids and foods in no-effort paradigms3,4,5,6,7. This pattern is likely to contribute to broader motivational impairments observed in rodents following chronic HFD, including reduced responses in operant self-administration of hedonic foods47, a diminished drive to work for food, impaired learning and reduced conditioned place preference when food reward serves as an unconditioned stimulus2,48. Similarly, human studies suggest that obesity and chronic HFD consumption reduce sensitivity to the rewarding effects of palatable foods, as evidenced by blunted activity in reward-related brain regions, such as the striatum and prefrontal cortex49,50.\n\nThe most parsimonious explanation that would account for this general reduction in hedonic feeding drive across different paradigms is that chronic HFD leads to a devaluation of calorie-rich foods. This explanation has been suggested previously2,3,4,51 and is supported by other cases where the perceived hedonics of food is deliberately altered. Examples include reduced pleasantness after food aversion52 or recent consumption (sensory-specific satiety53) and increased hedonic value of food during periods of food deprivation54, where a single change in reward value alters motivational drive across different paradigms. Nonetheless, it is also conceivable that mice are in a general state of reduced motivation owing to the delay in obtaining the food in these tasks55. Nevertheless, this does not explain why mice show reduced sucrose preference and will not consume hedonic foods in behavioural paradigms that require no effort3,4,5,6,7. Alternatively, the high-calorie foods offered to the mice during the acute feeding assay might not be perceived as appetitive as their high-fat chow in their home cages7,47. However, this does not explain why the changes in hedonic feeding behaviour initially persist when mice are placed back on a regular diet as shown in Fig. 2 and by others5.\n\nAlthough we propose that chronic HFD results in a devaluation of food hedonics, it may be challenging to comprehend why mice will continue to prefer high-fat foods over regular chow in their home cages and reach an unhealthy body weight. One possible explanation is rooted in the dual-system theory, which suggests that action control can be predominantly habitual or goal-directed56. Obesity is often associated with reduced behavioural sensitivity to changes in the motivational value of hedonic food rewards, indicating habit-like behavioural control that encourages overconsumption of food57. Another explanation is that devaluation of hedonic foods modifies feeding habits and circadian rhythm58,59, giving rise to obesogenic feeding patterns. Finally, a reduced drive to consume hedonic food may involve changes in locomotion or reduced exploration behaviour60, which may indirectly promote weight gain.\n\nOur results demonstrate that overexpression of NTS mitigates HFD-induced changes in hedonic feeding, anxiety, mobility, and home cage food consumption. While the primary driver of weight gain differences between NTS-OE and control mice remains uncertain, each of these factors has a critical role in obesity progression. Reduced anxiety, in particular, may not only improve food consumption behaviours but also enhance overall mental health, which is highly relevant for treating obesity and its comorbidities37.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, we identify a circuit mechanism through which NTS regulates hedonic feeding and demonstrate how disruptions in NTS signalling contribute to disordered consumption of calorie-rich foods. Given the role of these foods in driving the obesity epidemic, targeting NTS signalling in the NAcLat→VTA pathway may offer a promising strategy to regulate food intake and support healthy weight maintenance without disrupting other essential NTS-mediated functions.\n\nMethods\nSubjects\n\nThe following mouse lines (6–8 weeks old, male and female) were used for experiments: C57BL/6 J mice (Jackson Laboratory, 000664), NTS-Cre (Jackson Laboratory, 017525, strain code: Ntstm1(cre)Mgmj), GAD2-Cre (Jackson Laboratory, 010802, strain code: Gad2tm2(cre)Zjh/J), Ai14 (Jackson Laboratory, 007914, strain code: B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J), Ntsflox (Jackson Laboratory, 036262, strain code: B6;FVB-Ntsem1Evdr/J). Mice were housed on a 12 h:12 h light cycle (lights on at 07:00) and a room temperature of 22–25 °C and 55% humidity. All procedures complied with the animal care standards set forth by the National Institutes of Health and were approved by University of California Berkeley’s Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care.\n\nDiet protocols\n\nMice subjected to a regular diet (REG) had ad libitum access to standard chow (5053 PicoLab Rodent Diet 20, Lab Diet) in their home cage. Mice subjected to a high-fat diet (HFD) mice had ad libitum access to both standard chow and 60% fat chow (Research Diets D12492) for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to experiments. The body weight of all mice was assessed at least once per week.\n\nStereotaxic surgeries\n\nSurgeries were performed under general ketamine–dexmedetomidine anaesthesia using a stereotaxic instrument (Kopf Instruments, Model 1900). For retrograde tracing, mice were injected unilaterally with fluorescent retrobeads (100 nl; LumaFluor) or cholera toxin b subunit (400 nl; Fisher Scientific) into the nucleus accumbens (NAc) lateral shell (NAcLat; bregma: 1.0 mm, lateral: 1.9 mm, ventral: −4.3 mm) or ventral tegmental area (VTA; bregma: −3.3 mm, lateral: 0.4 mm, ventral: −4.5 mm) using a 1 μl Hamilton syringe (Hamilton).\n\nThe AAVs used in this study were from the Wilson laboratory (pENN.AAV.hSyn.Cre.WPRE.hGH; ~10¹³ infectious units per ml, prepared by AddGene), the Deisseroth laboratory (AAV5-EF1α–DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP; AAV5-EF1α-DIO-mCherry; AAV5-hSyn-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP; AAV5-Ef1α-DIO-eYFP; AAV5-hSyn-eYFP; ~1012 infectious units per ml, prepared by the University of North Carolina Vector Core Facility), from the Boyden laboratory (AAV5-Syn-ChrimsonR-tdTomato; AAV5-CaMKII-ArchT-GFP; ~1012 infectious units per ml), from the Tian laboratory; ntsLight1.1: The NTS sensor gene was cloned into a hSyn promoter and WPRE enhancer containing SV40 poly (A) signal sequence. The vector was packaged into an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9-ntsLight1.1-WPRE-SV40p(A), physical titre 6.45 × 1014 vg ml−1, produced by the Viral Core at the University of California Davis); ntsLight2.0: The NTS sensor gene was cloned into a hSyn promoter and WPRE enhancer containing SV40 poly (A) signal sequence. The vector was packaged into an AAV serotype 9 (AAV9-ntsLight2.0-WPRE-SV40p(A), physical titre 2.19 × 1016 vg ml−1, produced by the Viral Core at the University of California Davis; virus was diluted 5× with saline before injection), from the Földy laboratory (AAV-NTS-OE: the NTS precursor gene was cloned into a short CAG promoter and WPRE enhancer containing SV40 vector with two lox sequences on each side of the gene to make NTS expression Cre-dependent). The vector was packaged into an AAV serotype 9 (ssAAV-9/2-shortCAG-dlox-mNts(rev)-dlox-WPRE-SV40p(A), ~1013 infectious units per ml; produced by the Viral Vector Facility of the University of Zurich) and from the Lim laboratory (University of California San Diego, RG-EIAV-Cre).\n\nFor AAV injections, 300–500 nl of concentrated AAV solution was injected into the NAcLat (same coordinates as above) or VTA (same coordinates as above) using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus) at 150 nl min−1. The injection needle was withdrawn 5 min after the end of the infusion. Experiments were performed 6–24 weeks (for AAVs), 7 days (for retrobeads) or 2 days (for CTB–Alexa Fluor 647) after stereotaxic injections.\n\nFor in vivo electrophysiology, animals were implanted unilaterally above the NAcLat (bregma: 1.0 mm, lateral: 1.9 mm, ventral: −3.5 mm) with a custom-built driveable optoelectrode (optrode), which consisted of eight tetrodes (12-μm polyimide-coated nickel-chrome wire protected by silica tubing) glued to a 200-μm optical fibre using epoxy. The tetrodes protruded from the tip of the optical fibre by ~0.5 mm. Wire tips were cut flat, and gold plated to reduce impedance to ~200 kΩ at 1 kHz. A small screw fixed to the skull served as a ground electrode. Data collection began <1 week after the optrode implantations.\n\nFor in vivo optogenetics, animals received unilateral (for ChR2) implantations of a chronically implanted optical fibre (200 μm, NA = 0.37; Newdoon) dorsal to the VTA (bregma: −3.3 mm, lateral: 0.4 mm, ventral: −3.9 mm) or dorsal to the NAcLat (bregma: 1.0 mm, lateral: 1.9 mm, ventral: −3.6 mm). For ArchT experiments, optical fibres were implanted bilaterally and were angled (10°) above the VTA (bregma: −3.3 mm, lateral: ±1.2 mm, ventral: −4.4 mm). One layer of adhesive cement (C&B Metabond; Parkell) was followed by acrylic cement (Dental cement) to secure the optical fibre to the skull. The incision was closed with a suture and tissue adhesive (Vetbond; 3 M). The animals were kept on a heating pad until they recovered from anaesthesia. Atipamezole was injected intraperitoneally to reverse the sedative effects of dexmedetomidine.\n\nFor in vivo opto-pharmacology, animals were chronically implanted with a cannula (PlasticsOne, 33 G 4.6 mm) above the VTA (bregma: −3.3 mm, lateral: 0.4 mm, ventral: −3.9 mm). Opto-infusion experiments were done >1 week after cannula implantations. Injection sites and optical fibre placements were confirmed in all animals by preparing coronal sections (50 or 100 µm) of injection and implantation sites. Although optical fibre placements varied slightly from mouse to mouse, behavioural data from all mice were included in the study.\n\nFor in vivo fibre photometry experiments using ntsLight2.0, mice were chronically implanted with an optical fibre (400 μm, NA = 0.37; Newdoon) in the VTA (bregma: −3.3 mm, lateral: 0.4 mm, ventral: −4.5 mm) and above the NAcLat (bregma: 1.0 mm, lateral: 1.9 mm, ventral: −3.6 mm).\n\nAnatomical nomenclature\nNucleus accumbens\n\nThe NAc, a key component of the ventral striatum, is traditionally divided into shell and core subregions, which are both anatomically and functionally distinct61. In this study and in previous studies26,62,63,64, we describe an additional ventral striatal subregion, termed NAc lateral shell, which is located laterally to the NAc core. We realize that the terminology ‘NAc lateral shell’ may be misleading since it may suggest that the NAc lateral shell is part of the NAc shell, even though these regions are anatomically and functionally different. Nevertheless, we use ‘NAc lateral shell’ (NAcLat) as it refers to an anatomical region that is defined in the The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates65 (bregma: 1.34 mm to 0.74 mm).\n\nOur findings that optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway specifically increases the consumption of hedonic foods without affecting standard chow intake suggest that the role of NAc medial shell inputs to the VTA in hedonic feeding behaviour warrants further investigation. However, optogenetic stimulation of NAc medial shell terminals in the VTA predominantly inhibits dopamine neurons and induces a general state of behavioural suppression, which is not specific to either reward- or aversion-related behaviours26. This complexity would make interpreting the effects of optogenetic stimulation on feeding behaviour within the NAc medial shell pathway more challenging.\n\nVentral tegmental area\n\nWe defined the lateral VTA as the medio-dorsal and lateral parabrachial pigmented nucleus and the medial lemniscus region adjacent to the substantia nigra. Please note that the definition of medial versus lateral VTA is largely based on the anatomical location of projection-defined VTA dopamine neurons. It is not strictly based only on the medio-lateral axis, but also incorporates the dorso-ventral axis63.\n\nElectrophysiology\nEx vivo electrophysiology\n\nMice were deeply anaesthetized with pentobarbital (200 mg kg−1, intraperitoneal injection; Vortech). Coronal brain slices containing the NAcLat or VTA (200 μm) were prepared after intracardial perfusion with ice-cold ACSF containing (in mM) 50 sucrose, 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 0.1 CaCl2, 6.174 MgCl2, 2.96 kynurenic acid (NAcLat slices only) and 2.5 glucose (oxygenated with 95% O2/5% CO2). After 60–90 min of recovery, slices were transferred to a recording chamber and perfused continuously at 2–4 ml min−1 with oxygenated ACSF, containing (in mM) 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2.5 glucose, 22.5 sucrose, 2.058 MgCl2 and 2 CaCl2 at ~30 °C. Cells were visualized with a 40× water-immersion objective on an upright fluorescent microscope (BX51WI; Olympus) equipped with infrared-differential interference contrast video microscopy and epifluorescence (Olympus). For whole-cell current clamp recordings, patch pipettes (3.8–4.4 MΩ) were pulled from borosilicate glass (G150TF-4; Warner Instruments) and filled with internal solution, which consisted of (in mM) 135 potassium gluconate, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.1 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, 2 MgATP, 0.2 NaGTP, pH 7.35 (290–300 mOsm). For perforated-patch recordings, patch pipettes were first filled with internal solution, as described above, and then back filled with internal solution containing 100 µg ml−1 gramicidin. Electrophysiological recordings were made at 32 °C using a MultiClamp700B amplifier and acquired using a Digidata 1440 A digitizer, sampled at 10 kHz, and filtered at 2 kHz. All data acquisition was performed using pCLAMP software (Molecular Devices, version 10.5). Channelrhodopsin-2 was stimulated by flashing 473 nm light through the light path of the microscope using an ultrahigh-powered light-emitting diode (LED) powered by an LED driver (Prizmatix) under computer control. A dual lamp house adapter (Olympus) was used to switch between fluorescence lamp and LED light source. The light intensity of the LED was not changed during the experiments and the whole slice was illuminated (5 mW mm−2). Series resistance (15–25 MΩ) and input resistance were monitored online. Data were analysed offline using Clampfit (Molecular Devices, version 10.5). For recordings of spontaneous action potential firing, cells were held in current clamp mode and no current injections were made. Spontaneous firing was recorded for at least 3 s before and 5 s after light stimulation (20 Hz, 3 ms light pulses, 5 mW mm−2). For pharmacological experiments, we recorded baseline responses and drugs were bath applied for 5–10 min (1 µM SR142948A (Tocris), 1 µM neurotensin (Sigma Aldrich)). To determine the neurochemical identity of retrobead-labelled neurons (that is, TH-immunopositive or TH-immunonegative), neurons were filled with 0.1% neurobiotin (Vector), which was included in the internal solution, during patch-clamp recordings, then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 24 h later immunostained for tyrosine hydroxylase. The dopaminergic phenotype was confirmed in experiments shown in Fig. 4j–m. Neurobiotin was not included in experiments shown in Fig. 3a–f and Extended Data Fig. 9a–f. A more detailed description on the neurochemical identity of retrogradely labelled neurons in the VTA can be found in Lammel et al.64.\n\nIn vivo electrophysiology\n\nMice with optrode implants were attached to a fibreoptic cable that was connected to a 473 nm DPSS laser diode (Laserglow) through an FC/PC adapter. Laser output was controlled using a Master-8 pulse stimulator (A.M.P.I.). Power output was tested using a digital power meter (Thorlabs) and was checked before and after each experimental animal; output during light stimulation was estimated to be 3–5 mW mm−2 at the targeted tissue 200 μm from the fibre tip. Neural signals were recorded using a Digital Lynx 4SX system with an HS-18-MM headstage pre-amplifier (Neuralynx) with a Millmax connector. Recorded signals were filtered between 0.6 and 6 kHz and sampled at 32 kHz. Spikes were sorted offline using SpikeSort3D 2.5.4 (Neuralynx) software. To identify opto-tagged cells, the optrode was advanced ~40 µm per day, and a brief light screening (30 light pulses, 5 ms width at 1 Hz) was performed to detect light-responsive cells. If activity was detected, the mice proceeded to the behavioural assessment. If no activity was found, the optrode was advanced another ~40 µm, and the mice were re-tested for light-induced cell activity the following day. After behavioural assessment, the optrode was moved ~80 µm to minimize the likelihood of recording the same cells on subsequent days, and new opto-tagged cells were screened. Food consumption experiments while recording the neural signals, consisted of 3 behavioural trials (habituation, jelly, chow, 15 min each, order of food counterbalanced, 45 min total), and an opto-tagging trial at the end of the behavioural session where light stimulation was given at 2 Hz for 2 min. At the end of the opto-tagging stage, the optrode was moved ventrally for ~40 μm until active units were detected. The final recording location was verified using histology after the electrolytic lesions (12 μA, 30 s). ChR2-tagged neurons were identified by delivering 473 nm (0.8 mW mm−2, 1–5 ms pulses) of light at 2 Hz frequency for 2–3 min. A 2-ms bin with the highest number of spikes in the interval (0, +100 ms) around the laser pulse was identified. To test if the identified strongest response to light was higher than chance, we shuffled all the spike times in the same (0, +100 ms) interval 10,000 times and counted the highest number of spikes in a 2-ms bin for each iteration. If the number of spikes in the 2 ms bin from the real data exceeded the 99.9th percentile value of the distribution of number of spikes in the most active 2-ms bin for the shuffled data, we classified the cell as light-responsive. Response latency was defined as the average response time in the most active 2 ms bin, and only units with response latency <8 ms were classified as opto-tagged. Examples of the opto-tagging procedure in REG and HFD mice are shown in Extended Data Fig. 1i–r.\n\nPiezo-based analysis of feeding\n\nFor detection of feeding events, a piezo-based sensor was placed under the food cup. Cells were included in the analysis only if piezo sensor activity was detected. To obtain time-locked events, activation of the sensor was transmitted as a TTL signal to the Neuralynx recording system via an Arduino Uno board. Time spent feeding included the sum of events in which the sensor was activated at least twice and lasted until there was an interval larger than 6 s between the sensor activations. Piezo-detected events were confirmed by randomly inspecting 5 frames where the behaviour was determined as feeding in the analysis.\n\nVideo-based analysis of behavioural motifs\n\nA video-based offline tracking was performed via DeepLabCut66. Specifically, DeepLabCut.py (version 2.0.7) was used to track all points of interest. The network was trained using 20 frames from 6 randomly selected videos (containing mice of different diets and food types) for >1,000,000 iterations. Horizontal xy coordinates of the nose, head, body centre and the tail base were extracted for each frame. Only DLC coordinates of 85% accuracy and higher were used in the analysis. Deduction of behavioural motifs from the DLC obtained coordinates was done using a custom-made MATLAB code. The video start time was aligned to the Neuralynx recording system using the LED readout of the piezo sensor, and the matching TTL signal that was recorded directly to the Neuralynx data acquisition system via an Arduino Uno board. Deduction of behavioural motifs: feeding/empty motifs were defined as high proximity of the head position with either cup (<5 cm). Rearing was defined by close proximity of the body and head positions (<2 cm). Body and head orientation were determined as vectors from tail to body, and from body to head, respectively. Turning behaviour was defined as turning the head more than 15° from the body centre, which was then counted across a session67. The rest of the frames were classified according to velocity. Velocity was calculated by the distance of body position between frames, normalized to the size of the open-field chamber (in cm) and the frame rate (15 frames s−1). Velocity-based behavioural motifs were defined for in vivo electrophysiology as <1 stopping, 1–5 walking, 5–10 trotting, and >10 running (units of cm s−1). Velocity motifs were not included if the mouse was too close to the food plate (<7 cm from either plate) to avoid confusion with the food/empty plate motifs. Except for turning events, each motif occurrence was included only if it persisted for <7 frames (0.5 s). The behavioural readout and motif selection were visually verified for each experiment by randomly inspecting five frames of each motif to confirm the correct motif selection (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h).\n\nClassification of IR and DR response types\n\nResponse types during different behavioural motifs or piezo-based feeding events were classified into non-responsive, increased response (IR), and decreased responses (DR) using the following criteria: For each unit, average time series responses were collected around event onset from each motif type. Pre-event unit firing rates (−3 to 0 s before event onset) and event rates (0 to 3 s from event onset) were analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to determine statistical significance and the direction of change. IR: pre-event rates <event rates and P < 0.05; DR: pre-event rates > event rates and P < 0.05; otherwise, a unit would be classified as non-responsive. The proportion of the classified units (for both opto-tagged and non-tagged units) was analysed in REG and HFD mice and compared with the Chi-squared test; P value was corrected using the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.\n\nNeuralynxMatlabImportExport_v6.0.0 MATLAB package (available at https://neuralynx.fh-co.com/research-software/), custom MATLAB code and GraphPad Prism (versions 9.5.1 and 10.3.1) were used for analysis of in vivo electrophysiology data.\n\nBehavioural assays\n\nAll behavioural tests were performed during the light phase (unless otherwise specified) in a temperature (20–23.5 °C) and humidity (40–60%) controlled room that is illuminated by 8× 32 W fluorescent lights each producing 2,925 lumens. Behavioural equipment was cleaned with 70% ethanol between individual animals.\n\nAcute feeding assay\n\nMice were placed in a chamber (25 cm length × 25 cm width × 25 cm height) with 2 small empty food cups fixed to the floor on opposite corners. Following a 15-min habituation period, one empty cup was replaced with a cup containing a pre-measured amount of a specific food type (that is, standard chow, high-fat chow, chocolate, peanut butter, strawberry jelly, butter, water, or butter with quinine; note on preparation of butter with quinine: 30 g of butter was microwaved for 30 s to melt. 1.4 g of quinine (Q1250), dissolved in 15 ml of distilled deionized water, was thoroughly mixed into the butter. The butter–quinine mixture was then refrigerated until solidified and subsequently brought back to room temperature for use in the behavioural assay) that was weighed while the other cup remained empty. After each 15-min trial, the food cup was weighed again and subtracted from the initial weight to determine the amount of food consumed. Mice received a sample of each food type in their home cage and were habituated to the behavioural chamber on three different days prior to behavioural testing. This procedure was performed to avoid stress, and neophobia to novel foods, a characteristic behaviour in mice68.\n\nFor in vivo optogenetic activation, mice with optical fibre implants were attached to a fibreoptic cable that was connected to a 473 nm DPSS laser diode. Optogenetic experiments consisted of 5 trials in the following order: habituation, primed-feeding, OFF, ON, OFF (15 min each; 75 min total). During the habitation trial, mice could freely explore the chamber, but no food was present. We placed a new pre-measured food cup containing a specific food type into the chamber at the beginning of each subsequent trial. The primed-feeding trial allowed us to assess the effects of diet on feeding behaviour. Additionally, because feeding behaviour was reduced in the subsequent OFF trial, it allowed us to test the effects of optogenetic stimulation when feeding behaviour was low. During the ON trial, 20 Hz (or 1 Hz, 10 Hz for experiments in Extended Data Fig. 3d), 5 ms blue light was delivered through the fibreoptic cable. There was no optogenetic stimulation during the habituation, primed-feeding and OFF trials. In experiments shown in Extended Data Figs. 3e,f and 4c,d, mice were food-deprived (FD; that is, all home cage food was removed) 24 h before the start of the experiment. Food consumption during the primed-feeding trial under FD condition was compared to baseline levels of primed-feeding measured in the same, but not FD, mice (that is, baseline measurements were performed the day before initiation of FD and consisted of habituation and primed-feeding trials (15 min each)).\n\nFor in vivo opto-pharmacology (Fig. 4f–i), mice were placed in an open-field chamber and a custom-made optical fibre was inserted into the cannula for light stimulation. Same experimental design as above, except that between trial 1 and trial 2 (that is, laser OFF and ON trials), mice were placed into a separate box where they were infused with either saline or 6 mM SR142948A (500 nl via infusion pump at a rate of 300 nl min−1). There was an additional 10 min waiting period after infusion before animals were placed back into the chamber to conduct the remaining trials.\n\nFor in vivo optogenetic inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 3o–t), mice with bilateral optical fibre implants were attached to a fibreoptic cable connected to a 593 nm DPSS laser diode. The experiment was conducted over three consecutive days. On each day, mice were placed in a behavioural chamber for habituation (15 min, no food present), and jelly feeding (15 min). On day 2, constant laser light (10 mW) was delivered through the fibreoptic cable when jelly was present. Jelly consumption was measured for each day.\n\nHome cage feeding\n\nMice in home cage feeding experiments received a pre-measured amount of standard chow and 60% fat chow that was measured weekly for each cage. Food consumption was normalized to the number of mice in each cage.\n\nOpen-field test\n\nMice were placed in a custom open-field chamber (50 cm length × 50 cm width × 50 cm height) and their movement was recorded and analysed for 10 min using video-tracking. MouseActivity5.m (https://github.com/HanLab-OSU/MouseActivity/blob/master/MouseActivity5.m) was used to analyse open-field behaviour. To assess anxiety-related behaviour, we determined the time the animals spent in the centre of the chamber (33 cm length × 33 cm width)69. For analysis of behavioural motifs using DeepLabCut (version 2.0.7), we used a similar approach as described in ‘Video-based analysis of behavioural motifs’ to identify rearing, turning, and different velocity modalities. The behavioural readout and motif selection were visually verified for each experiment by randomly inspecting five frames of each motif (Extended Data Fig. 10h).\n\nReal-time place preference\n\nMice with optogenetic implants were connected to a fibreoptic cable and placed in a custom-made three-compartment chamber. For optogenetic stimulation, the cable was connected to a 473 nm DPSS laser diode (Laserglow) through an FC/PC adapter, and laser output was controlled using a Master-8 pulse stimulator (A.M.P.I.). Power output was tested using a digital power meter (Thorlabs) and was checked before and after each experimental animal; output during light stimulation was estimated to be 3–5 mW mm−2 at the targeted tissue 200 μm from the fibre tip. One side of the chamber was designated as the initial stimulation side (phase 1) and after 10 min the stimulation side was switched to the other previously non-stimulated side of the chamber (phase 2). The middle of the chamber was a neutral area that was never paired with stimulation. At the start of each session, the mouse was placed in the middle of the chamber, and every time the mouse crossed to the stimulation side, constant laser stimulation (473 nm, 20 Hz, 5 ms pulses) was delivered until the mouse exited the stimulation area. There was no interruption between Phase 1 and Phase 2. The first stimulation side was counterbalanced across mice. The movement of the mice was recorded via a video-tracking system (Biobserve, version 3.0.1.442) and the time the mice spent in each area (stimulated, non-stimulated, neutral) was calculated.\n\nBody temperature measurements\n\nTo measure body temperature, mice were manually restrained to minimize stress during measurement, and a rectal thermometer was inserted into the rectum to a depth of about 1 cm.\n\nNutritional values for different food types (all values per 1 g)\n\nJelly (Smucker’s Strawberry Jelly; calories: 2.5 kcal, total fat: 0 g, saturated fat: 0 g, trans fat: 0 g, cholesterol: 0 g, sodium: 0 g, total carbohydrate: 0.65 g, dietary fibre: 0 g, total sugars: 0.6 g, protein: 0 g), butter (Trader Joe’s Unsalted Butter; calories: 7.14 kcal, total fat: 0.79 g, saturated fat: 0.5 g, trans fat: 0 g, cholesterol: 0 g, sodium: 0 g, total carbohydrate: 0 g, dietary fibre: 0 g, total sugars: 0 g, protein: 0 g), peanut butter (Skippy; calories: 6.39 kcal, total fat: 0.5 g, saturated fat: 0.11 g, trans fat: 0 g, cholesterol: 0 g, sodium: 0 g, total carbohydrate: 0.25 g, dietary fibre: 0.06 g, total sugars: 0.11 g, protein: 0.22 g), chocolate (Hershey Kisses; calories: 4.88 kcal, total fat: 0.29 g, saturated fat: 0.9 g, trans fat: 0 g, cholesterol: 0 g, sodium: 0 g, total carbohydrate: 0.61 g, dietary fibre: 0.02 g, total sugars: 0.56 g, protein: 0.07 g), regular chow (PicoLab Rodent Diet 20; calories: 3.02 kcal, total fat: 0.05 g, saturated fat: 0.01 g, trans fat: 0 g, cholesterol: 0.14 g, sodium: 0 g, total carbohydrate: 0.54 g, dietary fibre: 0.04 g, total sugars: 0.03 g, protein: 0.21 g), high-fat chow (Research Diets D12492; calories: 5.24 kcal, total fat: 0.35 g, saturated fat: 0.18 g, trans fat: 0 g, cholesterol: 0 g, sodium: 0 g, total carbohydrate: 0.26 g, dietary fibre: 0.06 g, total sugars: 0.25 g, protein: 0.26 g).\n\nDevelopment of ntsLight1.1 and ntsLight2.0\n\nAll constructs were designed using circular polymerase extension cloning and restriction cloning. BamHI and HindIII sites were introduced via PCR for final subcloning onto pAAV-hSynapsin1 vector (Addgene). To enhance coupling between conformational changes and chromophore fluorescence, we used a cpGFP module from GCaMP6s for insertion into the human NTS1R. For screening linker variants, we generated linker libraries by first designing primers with 22 C saturated mutagenesis70 for one amino acid on each side of the linker (LSS-XI-cpGFP-XH-DQL). To screen ntsLight2.0 from ntsLight1.0, based on common activation pathway of class A GPCRs71, we generated libraries at region 5.61 and 6.33 for screening. Cloned constructs were amplified and purified with the Qiagen PCR purification kit before NEB 5α Competent Escherichia coli transformation. Competent cells were plated onto kanamycin-containing agar plate. After 24 h of growth at 37 °C, single colonies were picked into 96-well plates and grown overnight. Plasmids were purified using Wizard MagneSil Plasmid Purification System (Promega, A1630) with Opentrons OT-2 liquid handler. Top variants were sequenced by Genewiz. ntsLight1.1 was discovered after linker screening (LSS-XI-cpGFP-XH-DQL) and resulted in WI-EH. ntsLight2.0 screening resulted in I259M and G301T. To make AAV plasmids, NEB stable competent cells were transformed with pAAV plasmids. After overnight growth on an ampicillin-containing agar plate at 30 °C, a single colony was selected and sequenced. The colony with the correct sequencing result was then expanded at 30 °C in 100 ml of growth medium (2×YT), purified with a Qiagen Endo-free plasmid Maxi Kit, and sent to the UC Davis Virus Core for virus production.\n\nntsLight1.1 measurements in cell culture assays\nCell culture preparation\n\nGlass-bottom 96-well plates (P96-1.5H-N, Cellvis) were coated with 0.1 mg ml−1 of poly-d-lysine (Sigma, P6407-5MG) overnight. Plates were washed with water and E18 rat hippocampal neurons (BrainBits; https://tissue.transnetyx.com/E18-Rat-Hippocampus_4; not authenticated; not tested for mycoplasma contamination) were plated in neurobasal culture media with Neurobasal Plus Meidum (Gibco, A35829-01-500mL), B27 Plus Supplement (Gibco, A3582801), Glutamax (Gibco, 35050-061) and Gentamicin Reagent (Gibco, 15710-064). Neurons were infected with AAV9-hSyn-ntsLight1.1 (see above) on DIV5 neurons and changed to new media on DIV7. Half media change was performed every two days before imaging on DIV12.\n\nNeuronal cell titration\n\nNeuronal cell titration was performed in 96-well plate. Prior to a titration experiment on DIV12 neurons, stock solution of 10 mM neurotensin (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals) in H2O were diluted to 333 µM (in HBSS and 0.1 mg ml−1 BSA) and distributed in all of the first wells in 96-well plates. The following wells had serial dilution in HBSS for neuronal titration. For imaging with antagonist, stock solutions of 1 mM SR142948A (Millipore Sigma) in H2O were diluted to 200 nM in imaging media distributed across an empty 96-well plate (ligand plate) in triplicate. The imaging media consisted of 1× HBSS (Fisher, 14175103) containing HEPES buffer. Neurons grown in a separate 96-well plate (imaging plate) were gently washed 3x with imaging media, and the wells were filled with an appropriate volume of imaging media for the respective experiment. For titration experiments, 50 µl of imaging media was added to each well of the assay plate. Wells were then imaged with ImageXpress MicroConfocal High-Content Imaging system at 40× (NA 0.6) with 4 regions of interest (ROI) taken per well with no overlap of the ROIs (exposure = 300 ms) with MetaXpress software (version V6.6.3.55). Next, 50 µl from the ligand plate was transferred to the imaging plate containing a doubled desired final concentration. After 5 min of incubation, the same sites were re-imaged using the same settings. Titration was done with final concentration ranging from 150 µM to 1 pM, with tenfold serial dilution each time.\n\nLigand specificity test and validation\n\nNeurons were plated and cultured in a 4-chamber glass-bottom dish (35 mm, Cellvis) following the same protocol as described above. Neurons were imaged using 60× oil objective on a Leica Stellaris Confocal. The neurons were imaged in imaging buffer and 10 µl of the following ligands were applied directly to each chamber: NTS (10 µM, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals), GABA (100 µM, Tocris), dopamine (100 µM, Sigma), acetylcholine (Sigma, 100 µM), 5-HT (100 µM, Fisher), oxytocin (10 µM, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals), somatostatin (10 µM, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals), neuropeptide Y (10 µM, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals), cholecystokinin (10 µM, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals), dynorphin (10 µM, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals) and neuromedin U-25 (10 µM, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals). We observed a concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence in the presence of NTS that was attenuated by application of an NTS receptor antagonist (SR142948A) (Extended Data Fig. 6a).\n\nImage processing and analysis\n\nOnce imaging was complete, the images were exported and analysed using a customized MATLAB script (available at: https://github.com/lintianlab). In brief, segmentation was performed on individual images and a mask highlighting the membrane of the neurons was generated. Pixel intensities were obtained from the mask-highlighted area and exported into Excel. The ΔF/F values for each well were calculated.\n\nBrain-slice recordings using ntsLight1.1\nSlice preparation and imaging\n\nAcute coronal midbrain slices were prepared (same procedure as described in ex vivo electrophysiology), transferred to a recording chamber and perfused continuously at 2–4 ml min−1 with oxygenated ACSF. Slices were visualized under a custom-built, open source macroscope (https://github.com/Llamero/DIY_Epifluorescence_Macroscope) fitted with high power LEDs and a Teledyne Kinetix sCMOS camera. Custom drawn regions of interest were imaged at a rate of 20 Hz with a 10 ms exposure of 474 nm LED stimulation (5.2 mW mm−2) for a total of 20 s. In the middle of the recording, 1 s of 635 nm stimulation (17 mW mm−2) consisting of 5 ms pulses at 20 Hz was delivered to the slice between each camera exposure, so that none of the Chrimson stimulation light was recorded. Green light stimulation experiments were performed similarly to the red-light stimulation, with 1 s of 554 nm stimulation (8 mW mm−2) consisting of 5 ms pulses at 20 Hz. For pulse-width modulation experiments, red-light stimulation was delivered at 20 Hz with varying pulse widths. To determine dF/F in the lateral VTA, the fluorescence from an ROI drawn away from sensor and Chrimson-expressing regions was divided from the fluorescence in lateral VTA. Because photobleaching curves were not identical between different regions of the tissue, an additional baseline subtraction was performed. A window of dF/F signal around Chrimson stimulation time was removed, the remaining dF/F data was smoothed, and an estimated polynomial fit trendline was drawn through the smooth data and across the removed stimulation time window. This trendline was subtracted from the complete dF/F signal. AUC was calculated as an approximate trapezoidal integral during stimulation time.\n\nEx vivo validation\n\nTo examine NAcLat→VTA specific NTS release, mice were injected with ntsLight1.1 into the VTA and AAV-hSyn-ChrimsonR-tdTomato (Chrimson) into the NAcLat; a separate group of mice was infused with only ntsLight1.1 into the VTA (sensor only). Six weeks later, we recorded ntsLight1.1 fluorescence from VTA brain slices during light stimulation. Red-light stimulation increased ntsLight1.1 fluorescence in VTA slices of Chrimson mice, but not in ‘sensor only’ mice (Extended Data Fig. 6b–d). Additional optical control experiments revealed that the increase in ntsLight1.1 fluorescence reaches a maximum at 10 ms red-light pulse widths suggesting ntsLight fluorescence reflects dynamics of NTS release rather than total light delivered to tissue. Delivering blue-light or red-light stimulation in isolation was insufficient to increase ntsLight1.1 fluorescence (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f).\n\nntsLight2.0 measurements in cell culture assays\nCell culture preparation\n\nHEK 293 T cells (ATCC, CRL-3126; not authenticated; not tested for mycoplasma contamination) were plated and concurrently transfected with pCMV-ntsLight2.0 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, 2980874) according to the manufacture’s protocol. 24 h after transfection, cells were lifted using trypLE Express (Thermo Fisher, 12604021), pelleted (200 g for 2 min) and resuspended in 1 ml culture media containing DMEM (Gibco, 11995-065), fetal bovine serum (Gibco, 26140079) and Pen-Strep (Gibco, 15140148). Cells were then plated onto 4-chamber glass-bottom dishes and imaged the next day.\n\nSpectral measurements\n\nFor spectral analysis to determine the optimal excitation wavelength for ntsLight2.0, we used the Leica Stellaris 8 confocal microscope to perform both excitation and emission spectrum measurement. After washing each plate with HBSS (Sigma Aldrich, H8264-500ML), 90 µl of imaging media with 1× HBSS (Fisher, 14175103) and 10 mM HEPES buffer was added to the centre of each quadrant. For emission spectrum measurement, we used λ-scan mode (xyλ) by exciting at 470 nm and imaged with a range of emission wavelength from 480–610 nm with 10 nm step size and 10 frame accumulation. For excitation spectrum measurement, we used excitation lambda scan mode (xyΛ) by exciting with white light laser in a range of wavelength from 440–540 nm with step size at 10 nm. The detection range of the detector precedes the excitation wavelength during the lambda scan emission wavelength. For emission and excitation spectrum with neurotensin, 10 µl of 20 µM NTS was added prior to imaging. Analysis was done using custom code to calculate change in fluorescence (ΔF/F) with before (apo) and after (+NTS) ligand addition. Fluorescence changes were then normalized to the maximum fluorescence in each group (Extended Data Fig. 7b).\n\nPrimary hippocampal neuron with antagonist imaging experiment\n\nGlass-bottom 96-well plates (Cellvis) were coated with 0.1 mg ml−1 of poly-d-lysine (Sigma, P6407-5MG) overnight. Plates were washed with UltraPure Distilled Water (Invitrogen, 10977015) and air dried. E18 rat primary hippocampal neurons (BrainBits, https://tissue.transnetyx.com/E18-Rat-Hippocampus_4; not authenticated; not tested for mycoplasma contamination) were dissociated and plated with 38 thousand cells per well in FBS-based neuronal medium containing Neurobasal Plus Medium (Gibco, A35829-01), FBS, GlutaMAX (Gibco, 35050-061) and B27 Plus (Gibco, A3582801). On the next day, medium was removed and replaced with FBS-free neuronal media. On DIV4, half of the neuronal media was changed with new media containing virus AAV9-hSyn-ntsLight2 and removed three days later. Neuronal cultures were imaged on DIV12. Immediately before an imaging experiment, stock peptide solution was prepared in a 96-well treatment plate and serial dilutions (from 300 µM to 3 pM final in HBSS) were prepared across each row. 1 nM and 100 nM final concentration of SR 142948 A (Sigma, SML0015) were then added to the treatment plate. Before adding drug treatment, the 96-well assay plate were washed with HBSS three times and 50 µl imaging medium (vehicle) was added to each well. Baseline imaging was done using ImageXpress Micro Confocal High-Content Imaging System with MetaXpress software (version V6.6.3.55) using a 20× objective and capturing four regions of interest per well. Next, 50 µl of ligand per well from the treatment plate was transferred to the assay plate. After 10 min incubation, the same sites were re-imaged using the same settings. For titration controls without antagonist, only neurotensin from 300 µM to 3 pM dissolved in HBSS were used. Blank controls with vehicle were present in every condition. The images were exported and analysed using a custom MATLAB script (available at https://github.com/lintianlab) to determine changes in fluorescence (ΔF/F). Segmentation was performed on individual images and a mask highlighting the membrane of the HEK293T cells was generated. Pixel intensities were obtained from the mask-highlighted area and the ΔF/F values for each well were calculated and exported (Extended Data Fig. 7c).\n\nFibre photometry recordings using ntsLight2.0\nSignal recording and processing\n\nntsLight2.0 transients were measured using a custom-built fibre photometry (FIP) system63. In brief, fluorescent signals were obtained by stimulating cells expressing ntsLight2.0 with a 470 nm LED (60 μW at fibre tip). 470 nm LED light signals were released at 20 Hz and light emission was recorded using a sCMOS camera that acquired video frames containing the fibre (5 mm in length, NA 0.48, 400 μm core, Doric Lenses). A TTL signal generated by an Arduino Uno board was used to synchronize the camera and the FIP signal. Video frames were analysed online, and fluorescent signals were acquired using a custom acquisition code (available at https://github.com/handejong/Fipster) and later analysed in GraphPad Prism (version 10.3.1).\n\nOpto-photometry experiments\n\nntsLight2.0 signals in the VTA were recorded during optogenetic stimulation of NAcLat cells. Specifically, mice were placed in a head-fixed apparatus and connected to fibreoptic patch cords. A 640 nm collimated diode laser was controlled by an Arduino Uno, and laser stimulation times were recorded in the FIP acquisition system with a TTL signal. Each session had 30 trials, 60-s duration, composed of a short laser pulse followed by a delay period. For analysis, we generated peri-event plots of the z-scored data around the laser stimulation onset and analysed the timeframe of −10 to +30 s around the laser stimulation onset across all trials. We then quantified AUC at specific time points: baseline (−3 to −1 s), during laser stimulation (0 to 2 s) and post-laser stimulation (3 to 5 s).\n\nIn vivo validation\n\nNAcLat laser stimulation produced bidirectional ntsLight2.0 transients in the VTA composed of a fast negative peak that occurred during laser stimulation (0 to 2 s) followed by a slower positive peak (3 to 5 s). We performed several experiments to test which component of the signal reflects a change in NTS release: First, we compared the observed response in mice expressing both Chrimson and ntsLight2.0 (sensor) to mice that lack one of these components (that is, sensor only, Chrimson only). The positive peak observed in the post-laser stimulation period was increased only when both sensor and Chrimson were expressed (Extended Data Fig. 7d–h). Second, we tested the sensitivity of the signal to varying stimulation patterns. When testing different stimulation durations (1, 3 or 5 s, 10 mW intensity, 20 Hz) we observed that the post-laser stimulation signal had the strongest increase during the 3-s stimulation duration and a moderate change with 1- or 5-s durations (Extended Data Fig. 7i–l). Increasing the stimulation intensities (0.5, 5 or 10 mW intensity for 3 s, 20 Hz) produced a proportional increase in sensor signal (Extended Data Fig. 7m–p). Third, we analysed the sensor signal in response to laser stimulation (3 s, 10 mW, 20 Hz) following intraperitoneal injection of an NTSR1 antagonist (SR48692, Sigma Aldrich, 5 mg kg−1) or an equal amount of DMSO, which were injected 10 min before recording onset. We found that the slower positive, but not the fast negative peak, was blocked by the NTSR1 antagonist (Extended Data Fig. 7d–u), suggesting that laser stimulation produces a brief artefact that is followed by an increase of NTS release. While the nature of the artefact is currently unclear, it is also observed in recordings of other neuropeptide sensors, such as recently developed opioid sensors72, and adenosine sensor (GRABAdo)73. Future experiments are required to test if recruitment of additional neurochemical signalling processes during stimulation may suppress NTS release. Lastly, to test the sensitivity of the sensor to NTS, we continuously recorded the sensor for 20 min, and then the mice were injected with an NTSR1 agonist (PD149163, Sigma Aldrich, 0.3 mg kg−1, intraperitoneal injection). A TTL signal was delivered to the FIP acquisition system from a button pressed on an Arduino Uno board and the signal was recorded for an additional 50 min. The signal was aligned to injection timepoint, detrended and Z-scored averaged using a custom MATLAB code. AUC was analysed during the baseline period (−500 to 0 s before injection) and post injection (1500 to 2000 s). We observed a significant increase in sensor signal in response PD149163 but not saline injection (Extended Data Fig. 7v–x).\n\nSingle-cell patch RNA sequencing\nSample collection\n\nThe procedure was described previously74. To minimize interference with subsequent molecular experiments, only a small amount of intracellular solution (∼1 μl; not autoclaved or treated with RNase inhibitor) was used in the glass pipette during electrophysiological recordings. Before and during recording, all surface areas—including manipulators, microscope knobs and computer keyboard—that the experimenter needed to contact during the experiment were cleaned with RNaseZAP solution (Sigma). After whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, the cell’s cytosol was aspirated via the glass pipette used during the recording. Although the aspirated cytosol may have contained genomic DNA, our choice of cDNA preparation, which involved poly-A based mRNA selection, virtually eliminated the possibility of genomic contamination in the RNA-sequencing data. Cell collection microtubes were stored on ice until they were used. For sample collection, we quickly removed the pipette holder from the amplifier headstage and used positive pressure to expel samples into microtubes containing 1 µl cell collection buffer (1× Lysis Buffer and RNase inhibitor from Takara’s SMART-seq kits) while gently breaking the glass pipette tip. The sample was spun briefly, snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C until further processing.\n\ncDNA library preparation\n\nAs described previously74. Single-cell mRNA was processed using Takara’s SMART-Seq v4 and SMART-Seq Single Cell kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, the samples were reverse transcribed to cDNA and subsequently amplified. The samples were purified with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter), and the quality and quantity were analysed on a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical). Library preparation was performed using Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) as described in the protocol. In short, cDNA samples were fragmented and amplified using index adapters. The samples were then purified using AMPure XP beads and quality and quantity was assessed with the Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical). Following library preparation, cells were pooled and sequenced using Illumina Novaseq 6000 with 150 bp paired-end reads.\n\nBioinformatics\n\nAfter sequencing, raw reads were de-multiplexed using Illumina bc12fastq (version 2.20), and pseudo-aligned to the Ensembl GRCm38.95 reference transcriptome and normalized using kallisto (version 0.45.1). All data analysis was performed using Python (version 3.6.7) and R (version 3.5.1). For quality control, we calculated the median absolute deviation of each cell for the reads and the gene counts. Cells with less reads or gene counts than three times the median absolute deviation from the median were excluded. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using edgeR (version 3.24.3). Only genes that were expressed in at least 5 cells with a CPM value above 15 and the average CPM value has to be higher than 4 to be considered for differential gene expression analysis.\n\nIdentification of gene families\n\nThe Gene Ontology (GO) terms for identification of specific gene families was obtained from QuickGO platform (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/).\n\nSynaptic molecules gene family: GO:0005179 hormone activity, GO:0032098 regulation of appetite, GO:0007218 neuropeptide signalling pathway, GO:0007269 neurotransmitter secretion and GO:0007268 chemical synaptic transmission.\n\nFeeding gene family: GO:0007631 regulation of feeding behaviour and GO:0007631 feeding behaviour.\n\nSynaptic gene family: GO:0043083 synaptic cleft, GO:0097060 synaptic membrane and GO:0099536 synaptic signalling.\n\nIon channels gene family: GO:0006816 calcium ion transport, GO:0006817 phosphate ion transport, GO:0006814 sodium ion transport, GO:0006811 monoatomic ion transport and GO:0006813 potassium ion transport.\n\nEndoplasmic reticulum gene family: GO:0005783 endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nVesicle fusion family: GO:0031338 regulation of vesicle fusion, GO:0006906 vesicle fusion and GO:0098992 neuronal dense core vesicle.\n\nTranscription gene family: GO:0010468 regulation of gene expression, GO:0031564 transcription, GO:0090293 antitermination nitrogen catabolite regulation of transcription, GO:0045990 carbon catabolite regulation of transcription, GO:0000409 regulation of transcription by galactose and GO:0046015 regulation of transcription by glucose.\n\nHistology and microscopy\nImmunohistochemistry\n\nImmunohistochemistry was performed as described previously26,64. In brief, after intracardial perfusion with 4% PFA in PBS, pH 7.4, the brains were post-fixed overnight and coronal brain sections (50 or 100 μm) were prepared. Sections were stained overnight in a primary antibody solution: rabbit anti-TH (Millipore), chicken anti-GFP (Abcam), rabbit anti-DS Red (Living Colors), all at 1:1,000 dilution. Twenty-four hours later, sections were stained for 2 h in secondary antibody solution (goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 546, (all Thermo Fisher Scientific), goat anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488 (Abcam), all 1:750). Stained sections were mounted with DAPI-containing mounting medium on microscope slides. Image acquisition was performed with Zeiss LSM710 laser scanning confocal microscope using 20× or 40× objectives or on a Zeiss AxioImager M2 upright widefield fluorescence/differential interference contrast microscope with charge-coupled device camera using 5×, 10× and 20× objectives. Zen Software 2.3 (Zeiss) was used for acquiring confocal and epifluorescence images of brain slices. Images were analysed using ImageJ (NIH, 64-bit Java 1.8.0_172). Sections were labelled relative to bregma using landmarks and neuroanatomical nomenclature as described in The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates65. All images presented with multiple colours represent a composite of images collected with different excitation wavelengths.\n\nFluorescent in situ hybridization\n\nFluorescent in situ hybridization experiments were conducted using a commercially available RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit V2 (ACD Bio). Brains were extracted and snap-frozen by submerging them into frozen isopentane (−70 to −50 °C). They were stored in an airtight container in an −80 °C freezer. 16 μm coronal NAcLat brain slices were prepared using a cryostat, placed on Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific) and stored in a −80 °C freezer. On the next day, brain slices were fixed in 4% PFA in PBS (30 min) followed by an ethanol dehydration procedure (20 min). Slices were then bathed in hydrogen peroxide (10 min), followed by protease IV from the RNAscope kit (15 min). Next, probe mixes were made for Nts (Mm-Nts-C2), Ntsr1 (Mm-Ntsr1-C2) or Th (Mm-Th). A custom-made probe (Mm-Nts-O1-C2), targeting only axon 4 of NM_024435.2 (Nts) was designed to assess NTS expression after conditional knockout of Nts in Ntsflox mice (Fig. 4a–e). Probe mixes were applied to the brain slices for hybridization (2 h at 40 °C). After amplification of the signal (using AMP1, AMP2 and AMP3 from the RNAscope kit), channel C1 was developed using green Opal 520 (Akoya Biosciences, USA) and channel C2 was developed using orange Opal 570 (Akoya Biosciences). Finally, nuclei were stained using DAPI (from the RNAscope kit) and brain slices were sealed with ProLong Gold Antifade mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a glass coverslip. Images were taken using a confocal microscope (LSM710, Carl Zeiss) at 5 different z depths (spanning 4.4 μm), and images were flattened by taking the maximum projection across the z direction. ROIs were identified using a machine learning-based segmentation algorithm nucleAIzer based on the DAPI channel75. The amount of visible mRNA across the DAPI-identified region was used as a proxy for total mRNA in the cell. All identified regions of interest were manually sorted by an investigator who was blind to virus expression, diet, and probe mix. ROIs were removed if they: (1) showed overlap with other regions of interest; or (2) were segmented inadequately by the algorithm. The remaining cells were analysed based on the percentage of DAPI-positive pixels that were also positive for targeted mRNA or based on average fluorescence of targeted mRNA in DAPI-positive cells. To adjust for potential differences in staining and/or image quality, we compared pixels in all regions of interest to background fluorescence levels in each image. To do this, we first established a ‘null distribution’ that quantifies the distribution in pixel intensity values for cells putatively negative for targeted mRNA. Each cell’s distribution of pixel intensities was compared to the null distribution for the targeted mRNA and a correlation coefficient R was calculated. If the R of a cell’s distribution compared to the null distribution was less than 0.85, then a cell was labelled as positive for the targeted mRNA. For experiments in Extended Data Fig. 5i–m, mice exposed to regular diet (REG), 4-week HFD, or mice switched from a 4-week HFD to a 3-week regular diet were injected with a retrograde tracer (fluorescent retrobeads, red) into the VTA. 10 days later, the brains were extracted, and Nts mRNA was assessed in DAPI-positive NAcLat cells labelled with retrobeads.\n\nStatistics and reproducibility\nMain effect\n\nStudent’s t-tests (paired and unpaired), one-way or two-way ANOVA tests, and mixed-effect model analyses (for normally distributed data) and Friedman, Kruskal–Wallis or Mann–Whitney test (for non-normally distributed data) were used to determine statistical differences using GraphPad Prism 9 (version 9.5.1) and 10 (version 10.3.1) (Graphpad Software). Differential gene expression analysis was performed using Python (version 3.6.7), R (version 3.5.1) and edgeR (version 3.24.3). Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test (α set to 5%) and MATLAB (version R2024a) were used for the analysis of in vivo electrophysiology data.\n\nMultiple comparisons\n\nWhen a main effect or interaction were reported, Holm–Šídák (for normally distributed data) or Dunn (for non-normally distributed data) post hoc analysis were applied. Spearman correlation coefficient and linear regression were used to measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. Statistical significance was denoted by *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. for parametric tests, and as median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile for non-parametric tests.\n\nReplication\n\nSeveral experiments were replicated in at least two technical replicates from each of at least two mice and similar results were obtained. For example, establishing the HFD mouse model (Fig. 1a–d), optogenetics (Figs. 2 and 4i) and NTS-OE (Fig. 5f–l and Extended Data Fig. 10e–k). For anatomical experiments, wherever representative examples are shown (Fig. 4g,k and Extended Data Figs. 1a–d, 3a,b,n,q–t, 4a,b, 6h, 7aa,ab, 8e,f,i,j and 9a,d), similar results were obtained in at least two technical replicates from each of at least two mice.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\nData availability\n\nThe RNA-sequencing datasets generated during this study are available at the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession GSE287548. Source data are provided with this paper.\n\nCode availability\n\nCustom code used for the processing of fibre photometry data is available at https://github.com/handejong/Fipster.

Right: schematic overviews showing recording locations of all animals. Green indicates ChR2 expression. Refers to animals shown in Fig. 1. (b) Left: Sample fluorescent image showing ChR2-expressing (green) NAcLat terminals in the VTA of REG mice (red: tyrosine hydroxylase (TH); scale bar 500 µm). Right: schematic overviews showing ChR2 expression in NAcLat terminals (green) for all recorded animals (MM: medial mammillary nuclei, IPN: interpeduncular nucleus). Refers to animals shown in Fig. 1. (c, d) Same as in (a, b) but for mice subjected to a high-fat diet (HFD). Refers to animals shown in Fig. 1. (e) Mice with ad libitum access to high fat chow (HFD, orange) gained significantly more weight than mice who received a regular diet (REG, grey). Arrow indicates timepoint when electrophysiological recordings started (***p = 0.0009, nREG = 8 mice, nHFD = 7 mice, 2-way RM ANOVA with Holm-Šídák’s test). (f) Overview of data analysis pipeline for analysing opto-tagged and non-tagged single unit activity across behavioural motifs in freely behaving mice. (g, h) Sample frames from different behavioural motifs obtained from REG (g) and HFD (h) mice when they were presented with either jelly or chow. (i) Left: mean response latency to light stimulation for all recorded units in mice subjected to a regular diet (REG). Right: all opto-tagged units showed high correlation between evoked and spontaneous action potential waveforms (nREG = 21 units from n = 8 mice). (j) Top: spontaneous (black) and evoked (blue) averaged action potential waveforms for a sample NAcLat→VTA unit. Bottom: sample recording of an isolated unit with light-evoked and spontaneous spikes. (k) Sample plot showing spike sorting. A three-dimensional plot of simultaneously recorded units sorted according to action potential height detected at each recording electrode. Colours indicate action potentials that belong to separate sample units “Yellow”, “Red”, and “Blue”. (l) Sample units during opto-tagging trials based on plot shown in panel (k). Top: raster plots show example unit action potentials detected during each light delivery trial at time = 0 ms (blue line indicates delivery of 473 nm laser light;5 ms pulse; 2 Hz). Bottom: corresponding histograms show sum of all recorded action potentials across light delivery trials relative to onset of blue light stimulation (5 ms light delivered at time = 0 ms). “Red” unit is light responsive, “Blue” and “Yellow” units are not light responsive (FR: firing rate). (m) Corresponding histograms of 2 ms bins (grey) showing the max extracted spike count from shuffled unit spike data collected during opto-tagging trials. The 99.9th percentile from the shuffled data distribution (orange) is indicated by a blue vertical line. The observed max extracted spike count from any 2 ms bin spikes is indicated by a vertical red line. If the observed max extracted spike count (red line) was greater than the max extracted spike count from the shuffled data (blue line), then the recorded unit was classified as light responsive (i.e., opto-tagged). “Red” unit is light responsive, “Blue” and “Yellow” units are not light responsive. (n-r) Same as in (i-m) but for mice subjected to a high-fat diet (nHFD = 20 units from n = 7 mice). All data represented as mean ± SEM. All statistical significance was determined using a two-sided hypothesis.\n\nSource Data\n\nExtended Data Fig. 2 Piezo- and DLC-based analyses of opto-tagged and non-tagged units.\n\n(a, b) Heatmaps showing the relative Z-score average of individual NAcLat→VTA (opto-tagged) neurons (columns) during piezo sensor activation for jelly and chow feeding (rows) for REG (a) and HFD (b) mice. The bar graphs show the percentage of increased response type (IR, red), decreased response type (DR, blue) and non-responsive (white) opto-tagged units (**p = 0.009 for relative proportions of IR responses in REG versus HFD mice, nREG = 21 units from n = 8 mice; nHFD = 20 units from n = 7 mice; two-sided Chi-square test for proportions with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). (c, d) Diagrams showing a significant correlation between feeding events detected across all conditions with DLC analysis and piezo sensor for time spent feeding (c) (**p = 0.0044, n = 30 XY pairs from nREG = 8 mice; nHFD = 7 mice; r Spearman: 0.5, linear regression) and for opto-tagged unit firing rate (d) (***p < 0.001, n = 55 XY pairs from nREG = 8 mice; nHFD = 7 mice; r Spearman: 0.7, linear regression). (e) DLC-based analysis of average time spent in each motif for REG (grey) and HFD (orange) mice. There was no significant difference in the time REG and HFD mice spent in either motif (p > 0.05, nREG = 8 mice, nHFD = 7 mice, 2-way RM ANOVA). Data represented as mean ± SEM. (f) Diagram showing an inverse correlation between time spent and Z-scored firing rate across all behavioral motifs (***p < 0.001, nREG = 8 mice; nHFD = 7 mice, r Spearman: −0.5, linear regression). (g, h) Heatmap showing the relative Z-score average of individual NAcLat (non-tagged) neurons (columns) during different behavioral motifs (rows) for REG (g) and HFD (h) mice. The bar graph shows the percentage of IR (red), DR (blue) response types and non-responsive (white) non-tagged units in each behavioural motif (nREG = 70 units from n = 8 mice; nHFD = 41 units from n = 7 mice; Chi-square test for proportions with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). (i, j) As in (a, b) but for non-tagged units (*p = 0.0312 for relative proportions of IR responses in REG versus HFD mice, nREG = 70 units from n = 8 mice; nHFD = 41 units from n = 7 mice; two-sided Chi-square test for proportions with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons).\n\nSource Data\n\nExtended Data Fig. 3 Optogenetic manipulations of NAcLat → VTA pathway during feeding behaviors in REG mice.\n\n(a) Left: sample fluorescent image showing ChR2 expression (green) in the NAcLat (DAPI: blue; aca: anterior commissure; scale bar 500 µm). Right: schematic overview showing ChR2 expression in NAcLat for all REG mice. (b) Left: sample fluorescent image showing optical fibre location and ChR2 expression (green) in NAcLat terminals in the VTA (TH: tyrosine hydroxylase (red), IPN: interpeduncular nucleus; scale bar 500 µm). Middle and right: schematic overviews showing locations of optical fibers for all REG mice (MM: medial mammillary nuclei). (c) Food consumption during the 15 min primed-feeding trial in REG and HFD mice. During the primed-feeding trial, a specific food type (jelly, chocolate, peanut butter (PB), butter, high-fat (HF) chow, chow) or water was placed in one of the cups and mice were allowed ad libitum access for 15 min. REG mice consumed greater amounts of hedonic foods than HFD mice. (***p < 0.001, jelly: nREG = 18 mice, nHFD = 15 mice; chocolate: nREG = 19 mice, nHFD = 15 mice; peanut butter: nREG = 19 mice, nHFD = 15 mice; butter: nREG = 19 mice, nHFD = 15 mice; HF chow nREG = 18 mice, nHFD = 14 mice; chow: nREG = 19 mice, nHFD = 15 mice; water: nREG = 16 mice, nHFD = 15 mice; two-sided unpaired Student’s t-test for each food type). (d) Optogenetic stimulation of NAcLat→VTA promotes hedonic feeding behaviour in a frequency-dependent manner. Jelly consumption was measured on 3 different days in response to light stimulation of NAcLat terminals in the VTA. Same assay as in Fig. 2, except that, on each day, a different light stimulation frequency was used (1 Hz, 10 Hz, or 20 Hz). High frequency (10 Hz and 20 Hz) but not low frequency (1 Hz) light stimulation increased jelly consumption in REG mice (*p < 0.05, n = 10 mice, 1-way RM ANOVA with Holm-Šídák’s multiple comparisons test). (e) 24-hour food deprivation (FD) in REG mice significantly increases chow consumption in the primed-feeding trial when compared to sated mice (**p = 0.0041, nsated = 6 mice, nFD = 14 mice, two-sided unpaired Student’s t-test). (f) Optogenetic stimulation of NAcLat→VTA does not increase consumption of standard chow in food-deprived mice that are subjected to a regular diet (nChR2 = 7 mice, neYFP = 8 mice, 2-way RM ANOVA). (g) Mice consumed significantly less butter (B) adulterated with quinine (Q) during the primed-feeding trial when compared to regular butter consumption (*p = 0.017, nbutter = 10 mice, nbutter+quinine = 14 mice, two-sided unpaired Student’s t-test). (h) Optogenetic stimulation of NAcLat→VTA does not affect consumption of butter adulterated with quinine (p > 0.05, nChR2 = 7, neYFP = 7 mice, 2-way RM ANOVA). (i) Body weight of mice expressing ChR2 or eYFP in the NAcLat→VTA pathway was similar before and after the series of optogenetic stimulation experiments shown in Fig. 2 (p > 0.05, neYFP = 9 mice, nChR2 = 10 mice, 2-way RM ANOVA). (j) Left: on day 1, jelly consumption was measured for 15 min during the primed-feeding trial. 24 h later (day 2), the primed-feeding trial was repeated, but this time, mice received optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway. Right: jelly consumption was higher with optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway (on day 2) relative to baseline levels of jelly consumption measured on day 1 (**p = 0.008, nChR2 = 10 mice, neYFP = 8 mice, 2-way RM ANOVA with Holm-Šídák’s multiple comparisons test). (k) Experimental design for optogenetic stimulation of NAcLat cell bodies and NAcLat terminals in VTA. AAV-hSyn-ChR2 was injected into the NAcLat, and optical fibers were implanted above the NAcLat (i.e., NAcLat fibre) and above the VTA (i.e., VTA fibre). Mice were subjected to the same behavioural paradigm as shown in Fig. 2, except that on Day 1 NAcLat terminals in the VTA were stimulated and, on Day 2, NAcLat cell bodies were stimulated. (l) Jelly consumption during the primed-feeding trial did not differ between Days 1 and 2 (n = 6 mice, two-sided paired Student’s t-test). (m) Optogenetic stimulation (20 Hz, 5 ms pulses) of NAcLat terminals in the VTA, but not NAcLat cell bodies, increased jelly consumption (**p = 0.001, n = 6 mice, 2-way RM ANOVA with Holm-Šídák’s multiple comparisons test). (n) Left: Fluorescent images showing location of optical fibre in NAcLat (top, ChR2: green, DAPI: blue; scale bar 500 µm) and VTA (bottom, TH: red; scale bar 500 µm) (aca: anterior commissure, IPN: interpeduncular nucleus). Middle and right: schematic overview showing locations of optical fibres in NAcLat (top) and VTA (bottom) for all mice. Green indicates ChR2 expression. (o) Left: experimental design for optogenetic inhibition of NAcLat→VTA in REG mice. AAV-CaMKII-ArchT or AAV-hSyn-eYFP was injected into the NAcLat, and two optical fibers were implanted above the VTA. Right: experimental timeline: Mice were subjected for 3 consecutive days to the primed-feeding trial, but constant laser light was only delivered on day 2. (p) Jelly consumption in mice expressing ArchT or eYFP, with (day 2) and without (day 1 and day 3) constant laser light (nArchT = 7 mice, neYFP = 8 mice, *p = 0.032, 2-way RM ANOVA). (q, s) Left: sample fluorescent image showing ArchT (q) or eYFP (s) expression (green) in the NAcLat (DAPI: blue, scale bars 1 mm). Right: schematic overviews showing ArchT (q) ot eYFP (s) expression (green) for all mice. (r, t) Left: sample fluorescent image showing optical fibre location and ArchT (r) or eYFP (t) expression (green) in NAcLat terminals in the VTA (TH: tyrosine hydroxylase (red), IPN: interpeduncular nucleus; scale bars 500 µm). Middle and right: schematic overviews showing locations of optical fibres and ArchT (r) or eYFP (t) expression (green) for all mice (MM: medial mammillary nuclei). All data represented as mean ± SEM.\n\nSource Data\n\nExtended Data Fig. 4 Optogenetic stimulation of NAcLat → VTA does not promote hedonic feeding behavior in HFD mice.\n\n(a) Left: sample fluorescent image showing ChR2 expression (green) in the NAcLat (DAPI: blue; aca: anterior commissure; scale bar 500 µm). Right: schematic overview showing ChR2 expression (green) in NAcLat for all HFD mice. (b) Left: sample fluorescent image showing optical fibre location and ChR2 expression (green) in NAcLat terminals in the VTA (TH: tyrosine hydroxylase (red), IPN: interpeduncular nucleus; scale bar 500 µm). Middle and right: schematic overviews showing locations of optical fibres for all HFD mice (MM: medial mammillary nuclei). (c) 24-hour food deprivation (FD) in HFD mice significantly increases jelly consumption in the primed-feeding trial when compared to sated HFD mice (***p < 0.001, nsated = 15 mice, nFD = 12 mice, two-sided unpaired Student’s t-test). (d) Optogenetic stimulation of NAcLat→VTA does not increase consumption of jelly in food deprived HFD mice (nHFD-ChR2 = 6 mice, nHFD-eYFP = 6 mice, 2-way RM ANOVA). (e) Body weight measured at different time points when ChR2 or eYFP mice were subjected to HFD and then returned to REG (1-way RM ANOVA, nChR2 = 8 mice, neYFP = 7 mice). Blue arrows indicate time points when optogenetic experiments shown in Fig. 2g were performed. (f) Consumption of jelly during the primed-feeding trial in mice expressing ChR2 (black) or eYFP (grey) when mice were removed from HFD and returned to REG; tested at different time points over 3 weeks (***p = 0.0005, nChR2 = 8 mice, neYFP = 7 mice, 2-way RM ANOVA with Holm-Šídák’s multiple comparisons test; refers to Fig. 2g). All data represented as mean ± SEM, except panel (c), which is presented as median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile.\n\nSource Data\n\nExtended Data Fig. 5 Gene expression analysis in NAcLat → VTA cells from REG and HFD mice.\n\n(a) Volcano plot displaying differential gene expression in NAcLat→VTA cells between REG and HFD mice. Light blue data points indicate genes that are significantly differentially expressed in cells from REG versus HFD mice (i.e., absolute value of Log2 (fold change) > 1 and p < 0.05). The 10 genes with the highest expression differences are highlighted. (b) Each column displays the relative expression of GABAergic (Gad1, Gad2, VGAT) and glutamatergic (Vglut1, Vglut2) cell markers as well as dopamine receptors (Drd1, Drd2) for individual NAcLat→VTA cells (rows) from REG (left) and HFD (right) mice. Statistical significance was determined using a two-sided hypothesis. Values were not corrected for multiple comparisons. (c) Violin plots show expression of individual genes: Gad1 (left), Gad2 (middle), Drd1 (right) (REG: n = 23 cells from n = 10 mice, HFD: n = 20 cells from n = 11 mice). (d) Volcano plots showing differential gene expression between NAcLat→VTA cells from REG and HFD mice (REG: n = 23 cells from n = 10 mice, HFD: n = 20 cells from n = 11 mice). Points plotted indicate genes that are (red) or are not (gray) significantly differentially expressed between REG and HFD cells. Individual plots show subsets of genes related to feeding (top left), synaptic transmission (top middle), ion channels (top right), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (bottom left), vesicle fusion (middle right), transcription factors (bottom right). Genes marked in red are significantly differentially regulated by the criteria: absolute value of log2 (fold change) > 1 and p < 0.05. Statistical significance was determined using a two-sided hypothesis. Values were not corrected for multiple comparisons. (e) Violin plots showing expression of selected genes expressed in NAcLat→VTA cells that significantly differ between REG and HFD mice. Top: Npas4, PDE3b, Vti1a, ACHE; bottom: Syt12, Syn3, Pdk2, doc2b (REG: n = 23 cells from n = 10 mice, HFD: n = 20 cells from n = 11 mice). (f) Each row displays the relative expression of genes for individual NAcLat→VTA cells from REG (top) and HFD (bottom) mice. Each column displays a single gene that is related to synaptic signalling and feeding (587 genes are sorted according to median value; NTS gene is in the 98 percentiles, highlighted by vertical line) (REG: n = 23 cells from n = 10 mice, HFD: n = 20 cells from n = 11 mice). (g) Schematic showing retrograde tracing of VTA-projecting NAcLat neurons in NTS-Cre mice crossed to an Ai14 (tDTomato) reporter mouse line.

Middle: ntsLight1.1 fluorescence increased in a NTS concentration dependent manner (pink). The dose-response sensitivity of ntsLight1.1 fluorescence was reduced in the presence of NTS receptor antagonist (green, 100 nM SR142948A). Right: ntsLight1.1 increased fluorescence in response to NTS but with low response to Dynorphin, GABA, Neuromedin N, and other neuropeptides/transmitters. (NTS: Neurotensin n = 8, OXT: Oxytocin, n = 4; SST: Somatostatin, n = 4; NPY: Neuropeptide Y, n = 4; CCK: Cholecystokinin, n = 4; DYN: Dynorphin, n = 4; 5HT: Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), n = 4; ACh: Acetylcholine, DA: Dopamine, n = 4; NMU-25: Neuromedin U-25, n = 3; GABA: Gamma-aminobutyric acid) n = 3 (***p < 0.001; 1-way RM ANOVA with Holm-Šídák’s multiple comparisons test). (b) Left: experimental design for ex vivo imaging of NTS release using ntsLight1.1. AAV-hSyn-ChrimsonR-tdTomato was injected into the NAcLat and ntsLight1.1 was injected into the VTA of REG mice. Six weeks later, acute VTA slices were prepared for fluorescent imaging using an epifluorescence macroscope. Right: light stimulation and imaging protocol.

Middle: example ntsLight1.1 fluorescence extracted from the lateral VTA of REG mice injected with Chrimson in the NAcLat and ntsLight1.1 in the VTA (middle-left) or for REG mice injected with only ntsLight1.1 in the VTA (middle-right). Right: only mice expressing both Chrimson in the NAcLat and ntsLight1.1 in the VTA show increased fluorescence during red light stimulation (*p = 0.035, Chrimson and ntsLight1.1: n = 13 slices from n = 5 mice; ntsLight1.1 only: n = 3 slices from n = 1 mouse; two-sided unpaired Student’s t-test). (e) Left: mean ntsLight1.1 response to 1 s of 20 Hz red light stimulation with varying pulse durations. ntsLight1.1 fluorescence reaches apparent max fluorescence at ≥ 10 ms pulse duration. Right: ntsLight1.1 fluorescence corresponds with max activation of Chrimson rather than max amount of light delivered to VTA (**p = 0.0012, effect of pulse duration on ntsLight1.1 AUC, n = 3 slices from n = 1 mouse, 2-way RM ANOVA).

Optical fibres were implanted above the NAcLat and above the VTA in all experimental conditions. Six weeks later, NTS release was recorded in the VTA using fibre photometry during optogenetic simulation of the NAcLat in head-fixed mice. (e) ntsLight2.0 transients recorded in the VTA 5 s before and 20 s after 3-second opto-stimulation of the NAcLat in mice for 3 different experimental conditions: sensor only (red, n = 4 mice), Chrimson only (blue, n = 5 mice), and sensor + Chrimson (grey, n = 5 mice). Data are Z-scored, averaged across 30 trials, t = 0 s indicates stimulation onset.

(q) Mice received either DMSO or NTS R1 antagonist SR48692 injections (IP, 5 mg/kg) 10 min prior to FIP recordings. Experiments were performed in sensor + Chrimson mice (n = 5 mice) with n = 30 trials of NAcLat Chrimson stimulation (3 s, 10 mW, 20 Hz) while recording ntsLight2.0 transients in the VTA. (r) ntsLight2.0 transients recorded in the VTA 5 s before and 20 s after 3 s optogenetic stimulation of NAcLat in DMSO (back) and SR48692 (blue) injected animals.

Doug Wilson/Getty Images hide caption\n\ntoggle caption\nDoug Wilson/Getty Images\n\nIt all started with two kids who shared a geeky hobby.\n\nGrowing up in Seattle, childhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen were obsessed with an emerging industry called computing. As teenagers, they haunted the University of Washington's computer lab, the only place they could get their hands on the technology that so fascinated them.\n\nInterview highlights\nBill Gates reflects on his youth, beginnings of Microsoft, in new memoir\n\nBy 1971, they'd taken so many liberties with the lab's equipment that its director sent Allen a letter demanding he turn in his key. Little did Allen know that in 2017, he'd read that letter aloud to a crowd gathered to celebrate the dedication of a new computer science school in his name.\n\nBy then, Gates and Allen had accomplished their goal of helping put a computer on every desk and in every home, laying the foundation for the digital technology that has since proliferated into every corner of our lives. They called their company Microsoft, and it led the personal computing revolution.\n\n\nSponsor Message\nRevenge of the hobbyists\n\nIn 1975, the two friends were in their twenties: Gates was studying at Harvard and Allen had dropped out of college to take a job at Honeywell. Allen had a lightbulb moment that would change their lives — and ours — when he spotted an ad on the cover of Popular Electronics. It was for a build-it-yourself computer called an Altair 8800.\n\nAn Altair 8800 at the University of Washington's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering.\nMonica Nickelsburg hide caption\n\ntoggle caption\nMonica Nickelsburg\n\nA company called MITS sold the computer as a kit. An Altair was about the size of an apple crate, with no screen, just lights and switches on the front. You'd program it by punching holes into paper.\n\nAllen wondered if he and his friend could create a programming language for it.\n\nAllen \"went running to Bill and said, 'We have to catch this train,'\" said Ed Lazowska, a computer science professor and Bill and Melinda Gates chair emeritus at the Allen School at the University of Washington. \"The rest is history.\"\n\nTogether, they built something called an \"interpreter,\" which would tell the computer how to execute commands from the user. They offered to license the program to MITS, which could sell it along with the kits. MITS said yes. They were in business.\n\nAllen and Gates moved to Albuquerque to work with MITS, forming an informal partnership called \"Micro-soft.\" Their program for the Altair became Microsoft BASIC — think of it as the root of all their software that was to come.\n\nPaul Allen's original business cards from Microsoft's founding. Monica Nickelsburg hide caption\n\ntoggle caption\nMonica Nickelsburg\n\nMicrosoft wasn't the only company that was creating programming. Computer makers did, too, although sometimes it was just simple binary. The problem was, computer makers often wrote programs that only worked for specific machines. They couldn't be used on other devices. Microsoft's big idea was to make programming that worked on many models and could be sold separately.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe notion that software itself had value was novel — so much so that Gates had to write a letter to fellow hobbyists begging them to stop pirating it. \"As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software,\" Gates wrote in 1976. \"Hardware must be paid for, but software is something to share. Who cares if the people who worked on it get paid?\"\n\nAccording to Lazowska, this was a seminal moment for the fledgling software industry. \"The notion that software had value really stems from that letter that Bill wrote to hobbyists,\" he said. \"Of course, these days we think software is the value, in many ways. That's where the creativity arises more than anywhere else. That's one of the many things Microsoft brought to the world. It's the software industry.\"\n\nBack in the 1970s, the new industry was facing a big limitation: a small pool of customers. Computers mainly belonged to kit hobbyists — the early adopters who Gates was trying to persuade to become paying customers — or to the academic and business institutions that could afford much more powerful room-sized mainframes.\n\n\"When Microsoft was launched, digital technology was in universities and major companies in multimillion dollar computers, locked in big air conditioned rooms,\" Lazowska said.\n\nBut Gates and Allen had a moonshot idea: To put a computer on every desk. Running Microsoft software, of course.\n\n\"Now, digital technology is absolutely everywhere, and that's the transformation,\" said Lazowska. Today, he says, computing is so omnipresent — it's the phone in your pocket, the watch on your wrist, the laptop you use for everything — that we barely think about it. \"In many ways, it's the vision of Bill and Paul that drove that transformation,\" he said.\n\n\nThe PC boom \n\nMost people learned of Microsoft's next big innovation because it came preinstalled on the first home computers IBM rolled out in the early 80s. It was called the Microsoft Disk Operating System — MS-DOS, for short.\n\nA manual required to operate MS DOS, on display at a vintage computer festival in Seattle. Monica Nickelsburg hide caption\n\ntoggle caption\nMonica Nickelsburg\n\nIn a shrewd business move, Gates and Allen made sure they could license MS-DOS to any computer manufacturer, not just IBM. That non-exclusivity deal helped Microsoft software take over the world.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMS-DOS was groundbreaking, but it wasn't exactly user-friendly by today's standards.\n\nAt a recent vintage computer festival in Seattle, Michael Brutman booted it up on an early PC. \"The DOS environment is very minimal,\" he said. Really minimal. Just a black screen where you type in commands listed in a two-inch thick manual, which he also had on display.\n\nStill, the advent of the PC — short for personal computer — meant that ordinary people were learning how to type those commands. Even if they didn't work for a major research university or corporation, they might encounter a PC in their school or office.\n\n\" If you used an IBM PC, Microsoft was there,\" Brutman said.\n\nMicrosoft's next step into the desktop world was even bigger. Enter Windows.\n\nAll Songs Considered\nA Surprise Ambient Jam ... From Windows 95\n\nInstead of typing commands, Windows allowed users to navigate by pointing and clicking on colorful, intuitively-named icons. Microsoft didn't invent the graphic operating system, but it did make it cheaper and more widely available — and that really helped personal computers take off.\n\nFor University of Washington tech historian and author Margaret O'Mara, two things come to mind when she thinks back on Microsoft's greatest hits: \" I immediately think of Windows and Office,\" she said. \"I think of the system that by the end of the 1990s was running on nearly every single desktop computer in the world.\"\n\nBill Gates announces Windows 95 at a press event held in Redmond, Washington in 1995. Microsoft\n\nhide caption\n\ntoggle caption\nMicrosoft\n\n\n\nThat system introduced household names we still use today: Word, PowerPoint, Excel. The idea that applications could be used across industries and parts of society was something new.\n\n\"Software was a tool you could use in your home, in your school and in your office,\" O'Mara said. \"These were no longer separate things.\"\n\n\nAttempts to reboot \n\nBy now, Microsoft's moonshot was a success. The company did get a PC on every desk — running Microsoft software. Now it needed a new frontier.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMicrosoft was a software company, but by the early 2000s, its top rivals were scoring big wins in hardware. Apple built its devices in-house, giving the company more control and a product that was often sleeker and easier to use. Its iPod and iPhone were the superstars of the mobile technology world.\n\nTechnology\nMicrosoft's Zune Bids for Piece of iPod's Turf\n\nMicrosoft's attempts to compete — like the Zune, its 2006 ill-fated answer to the iPod — didn't pan out. Likewise, the Windows Phone and the Kin, Microsoft's 2010 forays into smartphones, were a bust.\n\nBut one of the company's big hardware reinvention efforts paid off. Microsoft branched out to become a gaming company, driven by the wild success of the Xbox video game console, which debuted in 2001. Hit games like Halo gave it unique appeal, and the idea to let gamers play together over the internet on Xbox Live set the gaming system apart.\n\nBill Gates stands in New York's Times Square days ahead of the original Xbox release in 2001. Microsoft hide caption\n\ntoggle caption\nMicrosoft\n\nToday, the company is reinventing itself yet again. Microsoft Azure, its cloud computing platform, has been a big revenue driver. The company uses its vast network of data centers to sell technology services to other businesses, many of which are adopting artificial intelligence applications and need cloud computing to run them.\n\nMicrosoft, too, is betting heavily on artificial intelligence. With its partner OpenAI, Microsoft has built ChatGPT into its Bing search engine. Microsoft is also increasingly outfitting Windows and Office products with Copilot, its in-house AI software.\n\n\"The company's ability to reinvent itself is remarkable, and that's pretty unusual,\" Lazowska said. \"Many companies just keep riding the same horse and don't change — and eventually fade away.\"\n\nFull disclosure: Microsoft is a financial supporter of NPR, but we cover them like any other company.\n\nMicrosoft\ncomputing\ntechnology\nBill Gates\nPaul Allen\nFacebook\nFlipboard\nEmail",

I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images\nMore than just chips: Chinese threats and Trump tariffs could disrupt lots of ‘made in Taiwan’ imports − disappointing US builders, cyclists and golfers alike\nPublished: April 4, 2025 1.48pm BST\nAuthor\nJay L. Zagorsky\n\nAssociate Professor Questrom School of Business, Boston University\n\nDisclosure statement\n\nJay L. Zagorsky does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.\n\nPartners\n\n\t\n\nBoston University provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation US.\n\nView all partners\n\n Copy link\n Email\n X (Twitter)\n Bluesky\n Facebook\n LinkedIn\n WhatsApp\n\nWhat would the United States stand to lose economically if its current access to the Taiwanese market were upended or totally restricted?\n\nThis seemingly theoretical question about the longtime U.S. trading partner has taken on more relevance in the past several weeks. First, longtime fears about a potential Chinese invasion of the island – which Beijing claims as its own – were magnified as China increased military pressure by sending patrols, firing live ammunition nearby, practicing blockading the island and even publicly revealing the existence of new barges that might be used in an invasion. If China uses force, Taiwan’s manufacturing capacity could be destroyed.\n\nThen on April 2, 2025, President Donald Trump announced a new 32% tariff on imports from Taipei, excluding semiconductors. Taiwan described the new tariffs, part of a radical upending of U.S. trade practices, as “deeply unreasonable.” They could also be deeply painful to U.S. consumers given the outsize role Taiwan imports play.\n\nThe U.S. State Department calls Taiwan an important U.S. partner in “semiconductors and other critical supply chains.” But as I learned studying trade data and visiting the small but thriving island last fall, the U.S. depends on Taiwan for more than just sophisticated computer chips. In 2024, Taiwanese products constituted 3.6% of all U.S. imports.\n\nOverall trade figures\n\nTrade figures are known in detail because almost every government carefully tracks the contents of all shipping containers, cargo flights and bulk deliveries that legally leave and enter their borders. These figures are published online and broken down into very fine detail using a system called the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, or HTS. The HTS shows the tax or duty that must be paid for each kind of item and from every kind of country.\n\nIn 2024, the U.S. exported US$1.7 trillion worth of goods to the world. Since few of us can conceptualize trillions, that is about $5,000 for every man, woman and child in the U.S.\n\nFor its part, Taiwan in 2024 exported about that same amount per resident of the island just to the U.S., $5,000 – or about $90 billion overall. The U.S. is Taiwan’s second-biggest trading partner, after mainland China. Looking at their total exports, Taiwan shipped to the entire world about $20,000 worth of items for every resident.\n\nThe vital technology component\n\nNot surprisingly, Taiwan’s biggest exports to the U.S. are computers, chips and other electronic hardware such as power supplies. These computer chips are so important that they were specifically excluded from the new tariffs.\n\nHowever, $90 billion of exports dramatically underestimates the amount of Taiwanese electronics that end up in U.S. hands. For example, the main chip inside all Apple iPhones is Taiwanese. However, these chips are sent from Taiwan to mainland Chinese factories where the phones are assembled. When these iPhones are exported from mainland China, the value of the chips inside the phone is not counted as U.S. imports from Taiwan. Instead, the whole phone is counted as an import from mainland China and slapped with a tariff.\n\nThe building industry\n\nBut while high-technology equipment often gets the headlines, imports from Taiwan are far broader – and the U.S. would face several economic shocks if Taiwan suddenly stopped exporting.\n\nFirst, the U.S. building industry could grind to a halt because Taiwan is a major producer of drywall screws. Though small and cheap, that’s a very significant product, given the prominence of drywall in the interior walls of almost every house, office and factory.\n\nMicrochip and Taiwanese flag displayed on a phone screen. Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nOverall, the U.S. uses a massive amount of drywall for new construction and remodeling. In 2024, the country consumed about 28 billion square feet of wallboard. That amount is enough to cover almost the state of Rhode Island.\n\nTo hang drywall, every 100 square feet of the sheets needs about 125 screws. And the vast majority came last year from Taiwan. The U.S. imported over two-thirds of a billion dollars’ worth of the screws; the screws weighed over half a billion pounds.\n\nWhile the U.S. does make screws, domestic screw manufacturers primarily focus on high-value parts such as screws needed for airplanes, rocket ships and other performance vehicles, not lower-value screws whose wholesale cost is slightly more than a dollar a pound.\n\nBeyond screws, Taiwan is a major producer of tools. For example, approximately two-thirds of all socket wrenches, band saws, blowtorches, air compressors and grinders imported into the U.S. come from that island. Losing access to tools is not as crucial as losing access to the screws because many tools last a long time. But finding new suppliers is not trivial.\n\nThe other basket of imports\n\nFinally, Taiwan is also a big U.S. supplier of sports goods.\n\nThe country is a major producer of bicycles, with manufacturers such as Giant. In 2024, the U.S. imported from Taiwan over a quarter of a billion dollars in just bike parts, which U.S. manufacturers such as Specialized and Trek use when assembling bikes.\n\nMoreover, Taiwan controls a few key parts of the bike market. For example, over half of all bicycle crank sets, derailleurs and brake parts came from Taiwan. Without these products it is impossible to pedal, shift and even stop a bike.\n\nTaiwan is also one of the world’s leading suppliers of golf clubs, with the U.S. in 2024 importing about a quarter of a billion dollars’ worth of clubs from the island. To go along with the clubs, Taiwan also sent half a billion golf balls. Given that about 25 million people play on golf courses in the U.S. each year, that works out to 20 balls per player in just 2024.\n\nFinally, the island sent over a third of a million lacrosse sticks last year, which is almost one new stick for every member of the USA Lacrosse federation.\n\nAll together, the data shows that not just Silicon Valley should be worried about geopolitical factors that disrupt imports from Taiwan. Taiwan might be a small island, but as the story of David and Goliath reminds us, size and impact are not related.\n\nTrade\nEconomics\nConstruction\nBicycling\nTaiwan\nSemiconductors\nGolf\nTariffs\nConsumer spending\nGlobal trade\nTrump administration\nMicrochips\nTrump tariffs\nUS-Taiwan relations\nTrump administration policies",

More\n\nGLOBAL IMAGES UKRAINE VIA GETTY IMAGES\n\nThe ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has been defined by the widespread use of innovative technologies that have reshaped the modern battlefield. While cyber warfare was expected to play a prominent role in this conflict, it has been generally overshadowed by the mass fielding of drones and the associated counter-drone systems. However, a recent video posted to social media suggests that Ukrainian drones are now being used to conduct minor cyber operations against Russia. The video, which appears to be of Russian origin, warns about various malware recently discovered on Ukrainian drones that have infected Russian systems.\n\nUkrainian Drone-Embedded Malware\n\nThe malware threats mentioned in the video are relatively minor, as they primarily affect the drone itself or the computer it connects to rather than targeting an entire network. According to the Reddit post featuring the video, the variants of malware on the Ukrainian drones are \"burning out the USB port, preventing reflashing, or hijacking the repurposed FPV and revealing the operator location.\"\n\nScreenshot from video discussing malware on Ukrainian drones. The video refers to these drones as ... More\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA CAPTURE\n\nThe inclusion of malware is significant, as both sides are rapidly competing for an edge in drone domain. The emerging threat of Ukrainian drone-borne malware infecting Russian computers could force Russia to implement new safety precautions to protect their systems. These measures would hinder Russian updates to their counter-drone technology which requires extensively studying the internal working of an enemy drone to find its vulnerabilities. As such, this would extend the timeframe that Ukrainian forces could effectively use a drone before it becomes obsolete due to Russian counter-drone technology.\n\nThe malware also appears to be designed to prevent Russia from repurposing captured drones, as one reported variant blocks the drone’s hard drive from being reimaged. Even if reimaging is possible, another reported variant allows Ukrainian forces to hijack the repurposed drone and potentially locate its new operator. The risks associated with this exploitation would limit Russia’s desire to reuse captured Ukrainian drones. Both sides face increasing resource constraints, making the ability to repurpose enemy equipment a valuable asset. By preventing Russia from doing so, Ukraine gains a strategic advantage.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n‘NYT Mini’ Clues And Answers For Sunday, April 6\nThese 6 U.S. Cities Lost The Most Airline Seats As Canada Reacts To Trump Policy\n‘Existential Threat’—Wall Street Suddenly Braced For A Bitcoin And Crypto Price Game-Changer\nBroader Implications Of Drone-Imbedded Malware\n\nThis tactic highlights how Ukraine is leveraging its strong pre-war information technology sector to counter Russia’s advanced military technologies and strong defense industrial base. Before the war, Ukraine’s IT sector was thriving with a deep talent pool of software engineers and cybersecurity experts. By embedding malware into their drones, Ukrainian developers have found a way to disrupt Russian counter-drone efforts without requiring additional physical resources, a critical advantage given Ukraine’s logistical constraints. If successful, Ukraine may begin integrating malware into other electronic systems to limit Russia’s ability to study or reuse them.\n\nThree screen captures from video discussing the drone burning out the USB port (top image), ... More\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA CAPTURE\n\nFurther, as Russia adopts additional cyber security procedures and more advanced anti-virus software, Ukraine could escalate its use of malware, developing more sophisticated codes to disrupt Russian military efforts. Future iterations could go beyond burning out USB ports to directly targeting Russian battlefield networks, exploiting vulnerabilities in command-and-control systems, or even enabling backdoor access for Ukrainian intelligence.\n\nUkraine’s use of malware will likely trigger a new technological competition, mirroring what is currently happening with Ukrainian and Russian drone technology. Russia will likely start implementing similar malware on its drones and equipment, while both sides respond by instituting safety protocols and developing anti-virus software to counter the malware. In turn, scientists on both sides will develop more advanced malware to defeat these countermeasures. This ongoing cycle of attack and defense will add a new dimension to the battle for drone supremacy.\n\nFor the past three years, Russian and Ukrainian scientists have been engaged in a technological struggle to provide their warfighters with an advantage on the battlefield. Ukraine’s decision to equip its drones with malware is the latest innovation aimed at preventing Russia from studying or repurposing captured systems. This development could influence the ongoing battle for drone superiority as well as the broader technological contest, especially as increasingly advanced malware is integrated into more Russian and Ukrainian systems.\n\nFollow me on LinkedIn.\nEditorial Standards\nForbes Accolades\nLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...\nFORBES’ FEATURED VIDEO",

    "title": "As gaming giants crumble, onchain gaming promises remain unfulfilled",
    "content": "Opinion by: Daryl Xu, co-founder and CEO, NPC LabsWhile gaming has been on a steady decline since the end of COVID-19 lockdowns, 2024 hit the industry especially hard, with layoffs and studio closures hitting even the most prominent studios.&nbsp;While unsustainable development costs and an innovation crisis seem to be the main culprits behind the collapse, Web3 gaming emerged as a potential solution promising to return power to developers &mdash; and it raised billions of dollars in investment to do so.&nbsp;Yet, despite a continued rise in crypto adoption, Web3 gaming has failed to capture mainstream players&rsquo; attention or solve any of gaming&rsquo;s fundamental problems. Why? Early blockchains were designed for financial applications. Game developers were forced to either build on blockchains that weren&rsquo;t designed for their use or create their own chains that isolated themselves from the blockchain ecosystem. Either choice led to poor player experience and an overemphasis on tokenomics.&nbsp;Many developers choose the latter, picking control over connectivity. Inadvertently, this resulted in walled gardens that were not dissimilar to the ones that contributed to traditional gaming&rsquo;s collapse.A solution that created more problemsA recent article in The New York Times revealed that over the last 30 or 40 years, video game industry executives have bet on better graphics to bring in players and profits rather than leaning on creativity. Traditional gaming development is costly, regularly exceeding $100 million per title. Indie developers often struggle to compete against large publishers who ultimately control funding and distribution.Blockchain seemed to be a promising solution for indie studios, providing them with new avenues to raise funds and giving them control over distribution. Early Web3 gaming platforms, however, ended up recreating the same enclosed systems that blockchain was trying to fix. With high player acquisition costs and limited Web3 gamers, Web3 gaming platforms deepened their moats to prevent users from moving away. As it continued developing, Web3 gaming introduced its own problems.&nbsp;An impossible choice for game developersThe technological infrastructures of layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum and Solana were created for finance and not aligned with gaming&rsquo;s requirements. Beyond transaction speed, layer-2 solutions were not designed to handle gaming&rsquo;s unique needs either.Game developers &mdash; attracted to Web3&rsquo;s funding model, promises of ownership and user engagement, are forced to either build on existing blockchains and compromise gameplay or launch their own chain &mdash; which diverts attention and resources away from what they want to do: make better games.&nbsp;Recent: Web3 gaming investors no longer throwing money at &lsquo;Axie killers&rsquo;While crypto native players may feel this is a worthwhile tradeoff, mainstream gamers want engaging experiences. A January DappRadar report showed that Web3 gaming had reached 7.3 million unique active wallets, but&nbsp; in speaking with the community anecdotally, approximately 10,000 of those represent the actual gaming cohort who aren&rsquo;t in games just to farm rewards. This number may be higher but is not more than 50,000 to 100,000 at the most.A misalignment with gaming cultureThe thing that converts mainstream users onchain isn&rsquo;t non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or decentralized finance, its meaningful ownership of in-asset games. Mainstream gamers have spent decades on arcade games, Nintendo or mobile games. If combined with true ownership of in-game assets, that familiarity is powerful enough to create a compelling experience for developers and gamers.While Web3 games claim to be revolutionizing gaming, most projects aren&rsquo;t listening to actual gamers. In actuality, they end up competing for the same crypto-native users. Rather than focusing on fun and engaging gameplay, most Web3 games are led by crypto technology and tokenomics. Within this bubble, success in Web3 gaming meant taking crypto users from each other rather than bringing new players onchain.&nbsp;With rare exceptions, the industry lost sight of what&rsquo;s important: making fun games that people want to play.This misalignment also extends to game developers who want to enter Web3 to create better player experiences and sustainable revenue models. Game studios understand the potentials of Web3 but are hesitant to navigate crypto&rsquo;s complex systems, which require technical skills to build protocols with sufficient liquidity and user bases while delivering seamless gameplay simultaneously.Make games fun againAs major studios continue to struggle, Web3 has a second chance to deliver on its promise. But this time, we must rethink how games interact. We must focus on creating access for creators and players instead of building new walled gardens. This requires Web3 gaming-specific infrastructure that provides both developer control and cross-ecosystem collaboration.&nbsp;The path forward is clear. We need to restore economic freedom to creators and put control back in players&rsquo; hands. That means revenue models that reward collaboration instead of isolation. Most importantly, it means returning to gaming&rsquo;s roots &mdash; making games fun again.&nbsp;The future of gaming isn&rsquo;t about better graphics or token incentives. It&rsquo;s about creating an industry where creativity and collaboration can thrive. When developers can focus on making engaging experiences instead of building moats, everyone wins.Opinion by: Daryl Xu, co-founder and CEO, NPC Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

    "content": "Cryptocurrency markets could be on track for recovery as investor sentiment begins to stabilize following US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s sweeping tariff announcement &mdash; what some analysts are calling the peak of recent market uncertainty.Trump announced his reciprocal import tariffs on April 2, which sent tremors across global markets. The S&P 500 lost more than $5 trillion, its largest drop on record, surpassing the pandemic-induced crash in March 2020, according to Reuters.Still, some analysts see a silver lining to the tariff announcement.&ldquo;In my opinion, the tariffs are the representation of the uncertainty in the markets,&rdquo; Micha&euml;l van de Poppe, founder of MN Consultancy, told Cointelegraph. &ldquo;Liberation Day is basically the peak of that period, the climax of uncertainty. Now it&rsquo;s out in the open. Everybody knows the new playing field.&rdquo;Van de Poppe added that he believes Trump is using tariffs as a strategic move to stimulate domestic growth and reduce yields. &ldquo;Tariffs are literally the only way to do that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they&rsquo;re reversed within the next six to 12 months.&rdquo;Average tariff rate on US goods and imports.

She added:&ldquo;With heightened uncertainty a given in these markets, we can expect more risk-off behavior, even though some short-term bounces may bring some relief.&rdquo;&ldquo;For crypto, BTC continues to act like a risk asset short-term while its analog counterpart gold breaks through one all-time high after another,&rdquo; a development that may impact crypto investor sentiment in the short term, Acheson said.Meanwhile, crypto intelligence firm Nansen estimated a 70% probability that the market could bottom by June, depending on how the tariff negotiations evolve.Magazine: Bitcoin ATH sooner than expected?

This IEI/HYG ratio, highlighted by analyst Caleb Franzen, serves as a proxy for credit spreads and is now showing its sharpest spike since the Silicon Valley Bank crisis in March 2023 — a moment that marked a local bottom in bitcoin just below $20,000.Historically, bitcoin and other risk assets tend to fall during sharp credit spread expansions. The key question now is whether this surge has peaked or if more downside lies ahead. If spreads continue to rise, it could reflect mounting stress in financial markets — and spell further trouble for risk-on positioning.A credit spread represents the yield difference between safe government bonds and riskier corporate bonds. When spreads widen, it signals growing risk aversion and tightening financial conditions. However, Friday's market action seems to indicate that bitcoin is starting to decouple from the traditional markets, outperforming equities. One analyst event called it the new \"U.S. isolation hedge,\" indicating that BTC might be starting to act more like a safe haven or digital gold for TradFi investors.

    "title": "Tried automating crypto trades with Grok 3? Here’s what happens",
    "content": "Key takeawaysGrok 3 adjusts its predictions based on evolving market trends by analyzing real-time data patterns.Combining technical analysis with sentiment data improves accuracy; Grok 3 effectively identifies potential trade opportunities.Backtesting strategies before live trading is crucial; testing Grok 3&rsquo;s prompts using historical data helps refine conditions and improve performance.While Grok 3 can automate trades, human oversight remains critical in adapting to unexpected market conditions.Crypto trading is complex. Prices can swing wildly, and even experienced traders struggle to keep up. That&rsquo;s why automation tools are gaining attention, with many now exploring Grok 3, an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) model from xAI (founded by Elon Musk).Grok 3 wasn&rsquo;t built specifically for trading, but its ability to analyze data, spot patterns and interpret trends has encouraged traders to test it for automated strategies. The idea is simple: Let Grok 3 make data-driven decisions, removing the emotional guesswork that often leads to poor trades.But does it actually work? Some traders report impressive results, while others find it unpredictable, especially in volatile markets.This article digs into what happens when you automate crypto trades with Grok 3. From successful strategies to unexpected risks, you&rsquo;ll get a clear picture of what to expect, plus actionable tips to improve your results.What is Grok 3 and how does it relate to crypto trading?Grok 3 is an AI model designed by xAI, an artificial intelligence company founded by Elon Musk. While its primary focus is natural language processing, some traders are now testing Grok 3 as a potential tool for improving crypto trading strategies. Unlike traditional trading bots operating on rigid rules, Grok 3&rsquo;s flexible design allows it to analyze diverse data sources and uncover patterns that might be overlooked.Why some traders are turning to Grok 3Grok 3&rsquo;s appeal lies in its ability to handle complex data, a crucial advantage in crypto markets, where price moves are often triggered by unexpected events or sentiment shifts.Here&rsquo;s where traders say Grok 3 has potential:Identifying market sentiment trends: Crypto markets are heavily influenced by emotions like FOMO (fear of missing out) and FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt). Grok 3 can analyze social media, news headlines and community discussions to assess changing sentiment, a key factor in crypto volatility.Recognizing hidden patterns: Grok 3&rsquo;s machine learning capabilities allow it to detect subtle correlations between indicators that traditional bots may overlook. For instance, Grok 3 may link an increase in social sentiment with rising whale activity to predict bullish momentum.Flexible analysis based on prompts: Rather than following static rules like &ldquo;Buy when RSI falls below 30,&rdquo; Grok 3 enables traders to design more complex strategies using natural language instructions.What happens when Grok 3 is used to automate crypto trades?Grok 3 isn&rsquo;t your typical crypto trading bot. It doesn&rsquo;t place trades directly or integrate with exchanges on its own. But it can help traders build smarter, faster and more flexible automation systems. From writing trade logic to analyzing market sentiment, Grok 3 is already being used in the real world to streamline how crypto strategies are created and tested.Instead of manually scripting every piece of logic, traders are now using Grok 3 to generate working code for bots. For example, a user asked Grok 3 to write token buy/sell logic with parameters like slippage, take-profit and gas priority fees. It generated a script that can be plugged into DeFi tools or expanded with 0x and Uniswap APIs.Some traders use Grok 3 to build end-to-end bots tailored to niche tokens or specific strategies. In another example, Grok 3 was used to create an automated system that scans price action and triggers trades under strict conditions. It doesn&rsquo;t just stop at buy/sell logic. Grok also writes portfolio rebalancing scripts and can simulate how positions would perform under different volatility conditions.Here is an example of a prompt fed into Grok 3, along with the output received.Grok 3&rsquo;s response: High-frequency trading bot framework for Solana (SOL)Below is a structured outline for a high-frequency trading bot framework designed for Solana (SOL), focusing on one-minute price fluctuations, risk management and trade execution. This outline provides a modular structure with placeholders for key components, avoiding specific implementation details as requested.1. Core configurationPurpose: Define global settings and constants for the bot.Components:Solana network endpoint (e.g., mainnet RPC URL)Wallet configuration (private key or keypair for trading)Trading pair (e.g., SOL/USDC)Timeframe (one-minute candlestick data)Trade size ($100 per position)Max trades (10 concurrent or sequential positions)Profit target ($50 total)Max loss per trade ($20)2. Data acquisition modulePurpose: Fetch and process real-time SOL price data.Components:WebSocket connection to Solana blockchain or exchange API (e.g., Serum, Raydium, or centralized exchange like Binance)1-minute OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data streamData buffer for storing recent price historyError handling for connection drops or latency3. Volatility analysis modulePurpose: Assess SOL&rsquo;s price volatility to inform trade decisions.Components:Placeholder: Calculate short-term volatility (e.g., standard deviation or ATR over one-minute candles)Placeholder: Define volatility thresholds (e.g., high/low volatility states)Output: Volatility score or signal to adjust trade frequency/size4. Trade signal generatorPurpose: Generate buy/sell signals based on price fluctuations.Components:Placeholder: Simple momentum strategy (e.g., price crossing a short-term moving average)Placeholder: Filter signals using volatility analysisSignal validation (e.g., avoid over-trading within one-minute window)Output: Buy/sell signal with timestamp5. Risk management modulePurpose: Enforce risk controls and position limits.Components:Position size calculator (fixed at $100 per trade)Max loss check ($20 per trade stop-loss)Total profit/loss tracker (halt at $50 profit or after 10 trades)Concurrent trade limiter (cap at 10 active positions)Emergency stop (pause bot on extreme volatility or connectivity loss)6. Trade execution modulePurpose: Execute trades on the Solana blockchain or exchange.Components:Placeholder: Build Solana transaction (e.g., swap SOL for USDC via a DEX like Raydium)Order type (market order for speed in one-minute timeframe)Slippage tolerance (e.g., 0.5% max slippage)Transaction signing and submissionConfirmation listener (await transaction finality)Error handling (e.g., retry on failed execution)7. Performance monitoring modulePurpose: Track and log bot performance in real time.Components:Trade log (entry price, exit price, profit/loss, timestamp)Running total profit/loss calculatorPerformance metrics (e.g., win rate, average trade duration)Alert system (notify on profit target, max loss, or errors)8. Main control loopPurpose: Orchestrate bot operations in a continuous cycle.Components:Initialize bot (load config, connect to data feed)Loop:Fetch one-minute price dataAnalyze volatilityGenerate trade signalApply risk management checksExecute trade if conditions metUpdate performance metricsExit conditions (profit target hit, max trades reached, or manual stop)9. Shutdown and cleanupPurpose: Safely terminate the bot and finalize operations.Components:Close open WebSocket connectionsFinalize pending transactionsSave trade log and performance summaryRelease resources (e.g., memory, wallet connections)NotesThis framework assumes integration with Solana&rsquo;s ecosystem (e.g., using a DEX or liquidity pool). Adjust the execution module if targeting a centralized exchange.Volatility analysis and signal generation are left as placeholders for customization (e.g., technical indicators or machine learning models).Risk management is strict to align with the $50 profit goal and $20 max loss per trade, ensuring the bot operates within defined boundaries.Caution! The above is a tailored outline shaped by the user&rsquo;s prompt, targeting one-minute price fluctuations, risk management and trade execution. Its output varies with prompt detail, as specificity sharpens results. Moreover, placeholders like volatility analysis await user customization, reflecting Grok 3&rsquo;s adaptive learning. It&rsquo;s a conceptual guide, not code, and success hinges on implementation and market conditions. For deeper refinement, such as Solana-specific tweaks, users can provide more context. Grok 3 adjusts using their input and its latest insights.Let&rsquo;s learn the general steps required to set up Grok 3 for automated crypto trading.How to set up Grok 3 for automated crypto tradingSetting up Grok 3 for AI-powered crypto trading automation isn&rsquo;t as straightforward as installing a typical trading bot. Since Grok 3 wasn&rsquo;t built for direct trading, it requires thoughtful setup, integration and customization. Below is a practical guide to setting up Grok 3 effectively for automated crypto trading with AI (artificial intelligence).Step 1: Choosing a compatible trading platformSince Grok 3 doesn&rsquo;t connect directly to crypto exchanges, it requires integration with third-party platforms that support API automation. Platforms like:3Commas: Ideal for executing trades via automated strategies.TradingView: Used for generating trade signals using Pine Script.CryptoHopper: Offers custom strategy-building tools with API integration.Ensure that the chosen platform offers robust API support for managing trade execution, setting risk controls and tracking performance.Step 2: Integrating Grok 3 with the trading platformGrok 3 doesn&rsquo;t connect directly to crypto exchanges; integration requires creative workarounds:API integration via automation tools: Platforms like Zapier or Make.com can connect Grok 3&rsquo;s analysis to trading platforms.Custom Python scripts: For tech-savvy traders, Grok 3's insights can be processed through Python scripts that execute trades based on Grok 3&rsquo;s recommendations.No-code automation tools: Services like IFTTT can trigger basic trading actions based on Grok 3&rsquo;s sentiment analysis.Step 3: Defining trading strategies with Grok 3Grok 3&rsquo;s success hinges on well-defined strategies. Unlike traditional bots that rely solely on technical signals, Grok 3 crypto trading bot can combine multiple factors, including:Technical indicators: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.Sentiment analysis: Social media trends, influencer opinions and news headlinesOnchain data: Whale activity, exchange inflows/outflows and large wallet movement.Step 4: Backtesting strategies before live tradingBefore deploying Grok 3&rsquo;s strategy in live markets, backtesting is essential to evaluate its performance. Backtesting can reveal:Accuracy of trade signals: Identify how often Grok 3&rsquo;s suggested trades align with profitable outcomes.False signal detection: Ensure Grok 3 isn&rsquo;t generating excessive buy/sell recommendations in volatile or stagnant marketsRefinement opportunities: Fine-tune conditions such as RSI thresholds, sentiment scores or trade exit conditionsExamples of tools for backtesting include TradingView and CryptoQuant.Step 5: Implementing risk management controlsEven with solid insights, crypto markets are unpredictable. Adding risk controls minimizes potential losses:Stop-loss orders: Automatically exits trades if prices move beyond a set threshold.Position limits: Restricts trade size to reduce exposure in uncertain markets.Trailing stops: Locks in profits during upward trends while minimizing downside risk.Example of risk control prompt: &ldquo;Write a code to handle buying and selling a token with the given parameters, including priority fees, slippage, and a take-profit mechanism.&rdquo;Please note that the output shown above is not complete and is provided for illustration purposes only.Step 6: Ongoing monitoring and strategy refinementGrok 3&rsquo;s strength lies in its adaptability, but it requires ongoing monitoring to ensure optimal results. Regularly review:Performance data: Assess win rates, profit margins and signal accuracy.Market conditions: Adjust strategy if major shifts (e.g., regulatory changes or macroeconomic factors) impact sentiment or momentum.Pro tip: Revisiting Grok 3&rsquo;s prompts regularly can refine strategy outcomes and improve long-term performance.Limitations of Grok 3Despite its strengths, Grok 3 has limitations that traders must consider.&nbsp;Data loss: Crypto trading thrives on accurate and real-time data. However, crypto trading automation with Grok 3 has been reported to lose chunks of data, miscount words and provide incorrect time references, which can be detrimental in a fast-moving market and result in inaccurate signal detection, delayed responses to market events and flawed strategy execution.No direct exchange integration: Unlike purpose-built trading bots, Grok 3 doesn&rsquo;t connect directly to crypto exchanges. Traders must rely on third-party platforms to execute trades.Forgetfulness: One of the biggest frustrations highlighted by some users is Grok 3&rsquo;s &ldquo;retrograde amnesia,&rdquo; when it forgets everything from previous sessions. For crypto traders, this is a nightmare. Imagine building a trading strategy and needing Grok 3 to remember past trends and conversations, only for it to start fresh each session.Bias: Grok 3 may deliver biased responses, potentially relying on incomplete or skewed sources. For traders who depend on unbiased sentiment analysis to gauge market mood, this shift could lead to misleading insights and poor decision-making.Slower execution speed: Since Grok 3 processes information based on detailed prompts, its trade signals may lag behind fast-moving price changes.Prompt dependence: Grok 3&rsquo;s accuracy depends heavily on well-structured prompts. Vague or incomplete instructions often produce unreliable results.While Grok-3 and other AI systems offer powerful tools for automating crypto trades, caution is essential. Their performance depends heavily on the quality of data and the strategies they&rsquo;re programmed with, meaning unexpected market shifts or flawed inputs can lead to significant losses.&nbsp;Remember, AI lacks human intuition and may struggle with unprecedented events, so relying solely on it without oversight is risky. Always test strategies with small amounts first and get help from experts before making large investments.",

    "title": "Bitcoin's Price Stability at Risk From Potential 'Basis Trade Blowup' That Catalyzed the COVID Crash",
    "content": "Bitcoin's (BTC) recent stability amid Nasdaq turmoil driven by tariffs has generated excitement among market participants regarding the cryptocurrency's potential as a haven asset. Still, the bulls might want to keep an eye on the bond market, where dynamics that characterized the COVID crash of March 2020 may be emerging.Nasdaq, Wall Street's tech-heavy index known to be positively correlated to bitcoin, has dropped 11% since President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced reciprocal tariffs on 180 nations, escalating trade tensions and drawing retaliatory levies from China. Other U.S. indices and global markets have also taken a beating alongside sharp losses in the risk currencies like the Australian dollar and a pullback in gold.BTC has largely remained stable, continuing to trade above $80,000, and its resilience is being viewed as a sign of its evolution into a macro hedge.\"The S&P 500 is down roughly 5% this week as investors brace for trade-driven earnings headwinds. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has shown impressive resilience,\" David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at 21Shares, told CoinDesk in an email. \"After briefly dipping below $82,000, it rebounded quickly, reinforcing its status as a macro hedge in times of macroeconomic stress. Its relative strength could continue to attract institutional inflows if broad market volatility persists.\" The perception of stability could quickly transform into a self-fulfilling prophecy, solidifying BTC's position as a haven asset for years to come, as MacroScope noted on X. Treasury basis trade risksHowever, sharp downside volatility in the short term cannot be ruled out, especially as the \"Treasury market basis trade\" faces risks due to heightened turbulence in bond prices.The basis trade involves highly leveraged hedge funds, reportedly operating at leverage ratios of 50-to-1, exploiting minor price discrepancies between Treasury futures and securities. This trade blew up in mid-March 2020 as coronavirus threatened to derail the global economy, leading to a \"dash for cash\" that saw investors sell almost every asset for dollar liquidity. On March 12, 2020, BTC fell by nearly 40%.\"When market volatility spikes - as it is now - it unearths highly leveraged carry trades vulnerable to big market moves. The blowup in the US Treasury market in March 2020, which disrupted basis carry trades, is a recent example. Risk of leveraged carry trade blowups is high...,\" Robin Brooks, managing director and chief economist at the International Institute of Finance,\" wrote to CoinDesk in an email. The risk is real because, the size of the basis trade as of March end was $1 trillion, double the tally in March 2020. The positioning is such that a one basis point move in Treasury yields (which move opposite to prices) would lead to a $600 million shift in the value of their bets, according to ZeroHedge.So, increased volatility in the Treasury yields could cause a COVID-like blowup, leading to a widespread selling of all assets, including bitcoin, to obtain cash.On Friday, the MOVE index, which represents the options-based implied or expected 30-day volatility in the U.S. Treasury market, jumped 12% to 125.70, the highest since Nov. 4, according to data source TradingView.The gravity of the situation is underscored by a recent Brookings Institution paper, which advises the Federal Reserve to consider targeted interventions in the U.S. Treasury market, specifically supporting hedge funds engaged in basis trading during times of severe market stress.Let's see how things unfold in the week ahead.",

    "content": "Solana&rsquo;s native token SOL (SOL) dropped by 9% between March 28 and April 4, but several key metrics grew during the same period. Despite SOL&rsquo;s price downturn, the Solana network continues to outpace competitors, maintaining its second-place position in deposits and trading volume. Traders now wonder how long it will take for SOL&rsquo;s price to reflect this onchain strength.Solana outperforms rivals in TVL deposits and DEX volumesInvestor&rsquo;s declining interest in SOL could be linked to the April 4 staking unlock of 1.79 million SOL, worth over $200 million. The selling pressure is clear, as these tokens were staked in April 2021, when SOL traded near $23. Another factor is the decline in interest for memecoins, which had been a major driver of new user adoption on Solana. With fewer speculative inflows, growth in activity may not translate to immediate price gains.Several meme-themed cryptocurrencies, including WIF, PENGU, POPCAT, AI16Z, BOME, and ACT, saw declines of 20% or more over the past seven days. Yet, despite worsening market conditions, the Solana network outperformed some competitors. Its total value locked (TVL) rose to the highest level since June 2022, while decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes showed notable resilience.Solana Total Vale Locked (TVL), SOL. Source: DefiLlamaDeposits in Solana network&rsquo;s DApps rose to 53.8 million SOL on April 2, marking a 14% increase from the previous month. In US dollar terms, the $6.5 billion total stands $780 million ahead of its closest competitor, BNB Chain. Solana&rsquo;s top DApps by TVL include Jito (liquid staking), Jupiter (leading DEX), and Kamino (lending and liquidity platform).Solana gains support for scalability and Web3 focus despite MEV concernsWhile not yet a direct threat to Ethereum&rsquo;s $50 billion TVL, Solana&rsquo;s onchain data shows greater resilience compared to BNB Chain, Tron, and Ethereum layer-2 networks like Base and Arbitrum. In decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, Solana holds a 24% market share, while BNB Chain accounts for 12% and Base captures 10%, according to data from DefiLlama.DEX volumes monthly market share. Source: DefiLlamaWhile Ethereum has regained the lead in DEX volumes, Solana has shown strong resilience following the memecoin bubble burst. For context, Raydium&rsquo;s weekly volumes dropped 95% from the $42.9 billion all-time high reached in mid-January. Still, Solana has demonstrated that traders appreciate its focus on base layer scalability and integrated Web3 user experience despite ongoing criticism related to maximum extractable value (MEV).Source: Cbb0feIn short, MEV occurs when validators reorder transactions for profit. This practice is not unique to Solana, but some market participants&mdash;such as user Cbb0fe, a self-proclaimed decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity provider&mdash;have raised concerns about insider gatekeeping. While not stated directly, the criticism likely refers to incentives provided by Solana Labs to offset the high investment and maintenance costs required by certain validators.Supporters of changing Solana&rsquo;s token emissions argue that rewards earned through MEV already provide sufficient incentives for validators to secure the network, eliminating the need for further inflationary pressure on SOL. Meanwhile, Loring Harkness, a core contributor to Shutter Network, advocates for encrypting transactions before they enter the mempool as a way to prevent validators from manipulating their order.Solana&rsquo;s growth in TVL and resilience in DEX market share may not be enough for SOL to retest the $200 level seen in mid-February. However, it has firmly secured its second-place position behind Ethereum as a leading platform for decentralized applications, supported by consistent activity, infrastructure development, and growing interest from both developers and users.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Let&rsquo;s examine these catalysts in detail.XRP nears a classic technical breakdown XRP's recent price action is flashing a classic bearish reversal signal dubbed &ldquo;inverse cup and handle formation.&rdquo;The inverse cup and handle is a bearish chart pattern that signals fading buyer momentum after an uptrend. It resembles an upside-down teacup, with the &ldquo;cup&rdquo; marking a rounded decline and the &ldquo;handle&rdquo; forming after a brief consolidation. Inverse cup-and-handle pattern illustrated. Source: 5PaisaA break below the handle&rsquo;s support typically confirms the pattern, often leading to a drop equal to the cup&rsquo;s height.In XRP&rsquo;s case, the rounded &ldquo;cup&rdquo; topped around March 19 and completed its curved decline by the end of the month. The ongoing sideways price movement between $2.05 and $2.20 forms the &ldquo;handle.&rdquo;XRP/USD four-hour price chart. Source: TradingViewA breakdown below this horizontal consolidation range could validate the bearish structure, opening the door for a potential move toward the $1.58 support area &mdash; as suggested by the measured move projection shown on the chart above.In other words, XRP can decline by over 25% in April if the inverse cup and handle setup plays out as intended.Source: Peter BrandtAdding to the sell-off risk is data from the volume profile visible range (VPVR) indicator, which shows the point of control (POC) around $2.10&ndash;$2.20 &mdash; a key support zone. A breakdown below this high-volume area could trigger a sharper drop, as lower volume levels below have offered little historical support in recent history.XRP/USD four-hour price chart. Source: TradingViewConversely, a strong close above the 50-period 4-hour EMA (red line) near $2.14 could invalidate the inverse cup-and-handle pattern. Such a breakout may shift momentum in favor of the bulls, potentially paving the way for a rally toward the 200-period 4-hour EMA (blue line) around $2.28.Related: Investor demand for XRP falls as the bull market stalls &mdash; Will traders defend the $2 support?XRP whale flow point to more sell pressureAs of April 5, CryptoQuant&rsquo;s 90-day moving average whale flow chart was showing sustained net outflows from XRP&rsquo;s largest holders since late 2024.

    "title": "Bitcoin Developer Proposes Hard Fork to Protect BTC From Quantum Computing Threats",
    "content": "Bitcoin could be headed for its most sweeping cryptographic overhaul yet if a new proposal gains traction.A draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) titled Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol (QRAMP) has been introduced by developer Agustin Cruz. It outlines a plan to enforce a network-wide migration of BTC from legacy wallets to ones secured by post-quantum cryptography.Quantum computing involves moving away from a process reliant on binary code, ones and zeros, and exponentially increasing computing power by employing Quantum bits (qubits) that exist in multiple states simultaneously. Such a jump in power is expected to threaten modern computing encryption built by classic machines.The proposal suggests that after a predetermined block height, nodes running the updated software would reject any transaction trying to spend coins from an address using ECDSA cryptography, which could theoretically make it vulnerable to quantum attacks.A hard fork debateBitcoin currently relies on algorithms, including SHA-256 for mining and the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for signatures. Per Cruz, legacy addresses that haven’t yet transacted are protected by additional layers, while those that have exposed their public keys—necessary to conduct transactions—may now be vulnerable “if sufficiently powerful quantum computers emerge.”The move would require a hard fork, which is likely going to be a tall ask from the community. A hard fork refers to a change to a blockchain that renders an older version incompatible.\"I admire the effort but this will still leave everyone who doesn't migrate's coins vunerable, including Satoshi's coins,\" said one Reddit user about the new proposal. \"Bitcoin could implement a post quantum security for all coins but that would need a hard fork, which due to bitcoin's history and the mantra repeated by maxis that would create a new coin and would not be bitcoin anymore.\"Read more: The Blocksize Wars Revisited: How Bitcoin’s Civil War Still Resonates TodayPreventive measureThe proposed solution sets a migration deadline to lock those funds unless they’re moved to a more secure wallet. This proposal isn’t a response to any imminent breakthrough in quantum computing. Instead, it's a preventive measure, yet it comes a little over a month after Microsoft unveiled Majorana 1, a quantum processing unit designed to scale to a million qubits per chip.During a migration window, users would still be able to move funds freely. The BIP calls for wallet developers, block explorers and “other infrastructure” to build tools and warnings to help users comply. After the deadline, non-upgraded nodes could fork from the network if they continue accepting legacy transactions.This is not the first time someone has suggested a mechanism to defend Bitcoin from quantum computing threats. Most recently, BTQ, a startup working to build blockchain technology that can withstand attacks from quantum computers, has proposed an alternative to the Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm involving quantum technology.In its research paper, BTQ proposed a method called Coarse-Grained Boson Sampling (CGBS). This process uses light particles (bosons) to generate unique patterns—samples—that reflect the blockchain’s current state instead of hash-based mathematical puzzles.However, this proposal would also require a hard fork involving miners and nodes replacing their existing ASIC-based hardware with quantum-ready infrastructure.Read more: Quantum Startup BTQ Proposes More Energy Efficient Alternative to Crypto's Proof of Work",

    "title": "Utility, volatility and longevity: Looking beyond the hype",
    "content": "Opinion by: James Newman, chief corporate affairs officer at ChilizThe perception of blockchain, especially for those outside the industry, has often been driven primarily by stories of extreme volatility, bad actors and speculation.&nbsp;In past months, the industry has been dominated by the narratives around the rise and subsequent fall of memecoins like HAWK, Fartcoin and LIBRA. Rewind to 2021, and lacking a genuine use case, the massive hype around non-fungible tokens (NFTs) failed to translate to long-term success, with the average NFT project today having a lifespan 2.5 times shorter than the average crypto project.&nbsp;For many, however, the appeal of these assets lies in their volatility, turning a few dollars into a fortune overnight. While NFTs and memecoins are undeniably part of Web3 culture, what sustains projects, keeps users engaged, and drives the industry forward is not volatility but providing genuine solutions to real-world problems. Ultimately, it&rsquo;s about utility.&nbsp;Utility drives stability&nbsp;Many blockchain projects fail because they are solutions searching for a problem rather than solving an existing one. Assets that offer no utility at all are unlikely to be more than a flash-in-the-pan moment of volatile speculation. While digital assets continue pushing technological innovation&rsquo;s boundaries, human needs for utility and tangible value remain constant. Moreover, a digital asset&rsquo;s utility promotes stability by shifting focus away from short-term speculation to meaningful engagement.&nbsp;When assessing the stability of a digital asset, its longevity is far more telling than short-term price swings. Volatility is inherent in crypto, but the accurate measure of resilience is whether a project can endure across market cycles. Fan tokens have demonstrated this stability, whereas NFTs &mdash; despite their initial boom &mdash; have struggled mainly to maintain long-term value beyond speculative hype.&nbsp;While memecoins certainly generate hype, their longevity is fleeting. 97% of memecoins launched in 2024 have already failed. There are exceptions, of course, but the overwhelming majority don&rsquo;t stand the test of time.In contrast, sports clubs have been issuing fan tokens since 2018, weathering both bull and bear markets. Their resilience comes from utility &mdash; fan tokens continuously evolve to reimagine fan engagement, bringing fans and clubs closer together.&nbsp;Solve problems, create value, establish longevity&nbsp;The connection between utility and stability is clear. Digital assets that solve real-world problems foster sustainable adoption. Instead of attracting speculators hoping for quick profits, utility-driven assets bring in users with a genuine need for or interest in the project.The rise of stablecoins underscores the importance of utility.&nbsp;Recent: Fan tokens offer stability &mdash; NFTs have notOver the past six months, stablecoin market capitalization has grown from $160 billion to $230 billion. According to DeSpread Research, in 2021, there were 27 stablecoins. By July 2024, there were 182, representing a 574% growth rate over three years. The reason? Stablecoins provide users real utility, whether you&rsquo;re a small business owner looking to transact across borders or a developer looking for liquidity for your decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol.Another indicator of an asset&rsquo;s utility is institutional adoption. To put it bluntly, BlackRock invests in Bitcoin (BTC). It offers BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) &mdash; not Fartcoin &mdash; because institutions prioritize assets with a proven track record of creating tangible value for their customers over short-lived, hype-filled speculation.For sports fans, emotional connections to their teams run deep &mdash; even if they&rsquo;ve never set foot in their team&rsquo;s stadium. Fan tokens fill this gap and tap into this emotional connection by offering more ways for fans to engage with their teams through direct participation and rewards &mdash; no matter where they are in the world.&nbsp;Whether voting on team decisions, accessing exclusive deals, staking fan tokens for additional perks or simply owning a piece of their team&rsquo;s digital identity, fan tokens provide utility through their lifecycle.&nbsp;The future of digital assetsTo bring it full circle, Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s original vision for Bitcoin was to solve a problem: an unfair financial system. 16 years later, despite the many applications of blockchain technology, this remains the reality of the asset.The future of digital assets will be defined by their ability to solve real-world problems, which is recognized by the clubs themselves. This is why they don&rsquo;t just issue fan tokens &mdash; they actively grant their IP rights to strengthen trust and credibility in the asset. When some of the world&rsquo;s most iconic sports brands embrace blockchain technology this way, it&rsquo;s a clear signal that the next era of fan engagement isn&rsquo;t on the horizon &mdash; it&rsquo;s already here. And we&rsquo;re only just getting started.Beyond fan tokens, blockchain is transforming the sports industry across multiple dimensions, with each use case becoming increasingly interconnected. Take Tether&rsquo;s recent investment in Juventus. The surge in the price of Juventus&rsquo; fan token underscores how deeply blockchain and crypto intersect across investment, sponsorship and fan engagement. With crypto sponsorships in sports surging in 2024, this convergence will only accelerate as clubs, leagues and brands explore new ways to harness Web3 technology &mdash; creating richer, more interactive fan experiences while unlocking new revenue streams.Opinion by: James Newman, chief corporate affairs officer at Chiliz.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

    "content": "US President Donald Trump's trade policies will create worldwide macroeconomic turmoil and short-term financial crises that will ultimately lead to greater adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) as a store of value asset, according to Bitwise analyst Jeff Park.Economic instability from the trade war will cause governments to adopt inflationary fiscal and monetary policies, which will further debase currencies and lead to a worldwide flight to safety in alternative stores of value, like Bitcoin, Park argued. This increased demand for BTC will drive prices much higher in the long term, the analyst concluded. In an X post on Feb. 2, Park predicted the immediate impact of a trade war:\"The tariff costs, most likely through higher inflation, will be shared by both the US and trading partners, but the relative impact will be much heavier on foreigners. These countries will then have to find a way to fend off their weak growth issues.\"Despite the Increased demand for Bitcoin as a store of value against rapidly depreciating fiat currencies driving BTC prices higher in the long term, global financial markets would feel the short-term pain and wealth destruction of the trade war, according to Park.Bitcoin hit with short-term price shock due to COVID-19 in March 2020 before rallying to all-time highs during the 2020-2021 bull market.

    "content": "President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariff unveiling had led to a $5.4 trillion U.S. equities market wipeout in just two days as the S&P 500 index dropped to its lowest level in 11 months and the Nasdaq 100 entered bear market territory.Yet, amidst the chaos, cryptocurrency prices are showing resiliency, with bitcoin (BTC) dropping roughly 6% since the tariffs were unveiled, compared to the Nasdaq’s 11% drop. The broader crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, dropped by roughly 4.9% over the same period.To put the sell-off figures into perspective, the total crypto market cap is around $2.65 trillion, according to data from TheTie.

It significantly outperformed the Nasdaq on Friday, which plunged 5.8%.Cryptocurrency prices are likely to remain resilient. Given their accessibility through traditional investment products, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and their performance, they could be “useful as a TradFi hedge,” according to Standard Chartered’s Geoffrey Kendrick.“Over the last 36 hours I think we can also add 'US isolation' hedge to the list of bitcoin uses,” Kendrick wrote in an email dated April 4, adding in a chart showing that among the Magnificent 7 stocks, only Microsoft outperformed BTC during the sell-off.The resilience is also coming as the crypto community celebrated the purported birthday of bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. The date is based on the bitcoin creator’s profile with the P2P Foundation.The date, some speculate, isn’t real but instead symbolic. It coincides with the anniversary of Executive Order 6102, signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on April 5, 1933.

    "title": "Why OFAC Delisted Tornado Cash",
    "content": "Last month, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control delisted Tornado Cash from its sanctions list, months after an appeals court ruled that the watchdog could not designate the mixer's smart contracts.You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.Fair windsThe narrativeIn November 2024, a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled that the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) couldn't sanction smart contracts tied to crypto mixer Tornado Cash. Last month, OFAC delisted Tornado Cash entirely, though it left developer Roman Semenov on its Specially Designated Nationals list.Why it mattersWhether Tornado Cash could be sanctioned to begin with has been a point of contention for the crypto industry. The Fifth Circuit ruling sparked a rally in the TORN token's price and raised hopes that it would be more difficult for the U.S. government to block legal uses of mixers.Breaking it downTornado Cash's delisting included smart contract addresses and other components of the overall mixer, and followed November's ruling. The delisting may have been an effort to preempt a court ruling that would force OFAC to permanently delist Tornado Cash.Backing up a little: A group of developers sued OFAC after Tornado Cash was first sanctioned with backing from crypto exchange Coinbase. That case, Van Loon v. Treasury, received an initial ruling from a district court judge that was favorable to the Treasury Department. On appeal, however, the Fifth Circuit ruled — somewhat narrowly — that smart contracts were outside the scope of OFAC's jurisdiction. The appeals court panel threw the case back down to the district court to sort out next steps.On March 21, the same day it removed Tornado Cash from its sanctions list, OFAC filed a notice telling the court that the removal meant the legal case remedies cot \"the matter is now moot.\"Peter Van Valkenburgh, the executive director at Coin Center, said the November decision left OFAC with few options.\"They could have waited for the court to invalidate the sanctions or they could have delisted them themselves, and they delisted themselves,\" he said. \"You can read that two ways. You can read that as 'I want to try and preserve some ability to fight in the future or [make] some other listing,' [and] that's really tough because that Fifth Circuit opinion is really bad for them.\"The other read for the delisting is OFAC just wanted the matter resolved quickly, he said.Leah Moushey, an attorney with Miller & Chevalier, said the court may choose to reject OFAC's filing because there's an open question as to whether Tornado Cash can be redesignated in the future. She pointed to a Supreme Court case with thematic similarities.The court said in that case, FBI v. Fikre, that the U.S. government had not sufficiently proven that just removing an individual from a no-fly list meant he would never be placed back on the list.OFAC may have to show in this case that Tornado Cash can't be designated again.Another open question for Tornado Cash is whether the delisting has any bearing on the U.S. Department of Justice's criminal case against developer Roman Storm. After the Fifth Circuit ruling, Storm's attorneys filed a motion asking the judge overseeing the criminal case to dismiss the indictment, but the judge has already ruled that the case should move forward.\"The judge determined that the scope of the conduct went beyond the interactions with the smart contract,\" Moushey said. The Fifth Circuit ruling did not discuss Tornado Cash as an entity.Van Valkenburgh noted that OFAC left its sanctions against Semenov in place, and the DOJ will continue to try and argue Storm conspired to violate sanctions.The Storm case is currently set for trial in July.Stories you may have missedIllinois to Drop Staking Lawsuit Against Coinbase: Illinois has become the latest state to announce it would drop its lawsuit against Coinbase, joining Kentucky, Vermont and South Carolina.

    "title": "BlackRock’s BUIDL fund explained: Why it matters for crypto and TradFi",
    "content": "What is BlackRock&rsquo;s BUIDL fund? BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Fund, BUIDL, is BlackRock&rsquo;s first tokenized money market fund. It enables these traditional financial products to be traded as cryptographic tokens on blockchains.&nbsp;A money market fund is a mutual fund that invests in high liquidity, short-term debt instruments. These funds aim to provide investors with a place to park money temporarily, returning a level of income without massive capital appreciation. They typically include cash, cash equivalents and high-credit rating debt securities like US Treasurys.Blackrock is the world&rsquo;s largest asset manager. It now provides blockchain-based money markets via blockchains like Solana and Ethereum. Essentially, the firm has taken the idea of traditional money market funds and combined it with the distributed ledger and payment characteristics of blockchains.&nbsp;The fund has reported explosive growth, rocketing from $667 million to $1.8 billion of assets under management in just three weeks. As of March 31, 2025, the fund continues to attract a steady inflow of capital, with an increasing number of crypto-savvy investors choosing to park their funds in BUIDL via the seven blockchains it currently operates on:EthereumSolanaAptosArbitrumAvalancheOptimismPolygonThe BUIDL launch marks one of the most significant institutional moves into mixing traditional finance (TradFi) and blockchain-based products. It signals another step in Blackrock&rsquo;s crypto strategy towards mainstream financial acceptance of crypto and blockchain.&nbsp;This institutional crypto adoption from a respected asset manager with trillions of dollars of assets under management further legitimizes the space and may trigger a new wave of capital inflows from institutional adoption.&nbsp; How does BUIDL work? BUIDL is a tokenized fund. It invests in dollar-equivalent assets like US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements. Investors buy and sell BUIDL tokens, which are pegged to the dollar and pay dividends daily to an investor&rsquo;s wallet as new tokens every month.Investors can enjoy earning yields while retaining the security of traditional finance instruments. It is a form of real-world asset tokenization (RWA) that involves creating a digital representation of an asset.&nbsp;This digital representation is a blockchain-based token, similar to cryptocurrency, that can be traded on relevant decentralized networks. Traditional asset transfers usually take days to settle and have poor capital efficiency. Tokenized assets allow near-instant trades and settlements to speed up financial processes while enabling better automation for reduced costs.A hybrid approach creates a TradFi and crypto bridge to give investors the best of both worlds with the stability of regulated financial products and the efficiency of blockchain.Did you know? Part of Sky&rsquo;s (formerly MakerDAO) $1 billion RWA allocation announced in 2024, Superstate secured a chunk (estimated $200 million&ndash;300 million) in March 2025, pushing its AUM past $400 million. The tokenized Treasury market&rsquo;s $5 billion milestone supports this growth. Why BUIDL matters for crypto The BlackRock BUIDL fund ushers in the next level of institutional legitimacy to the crypto ecosystem. Regulated institutions and entities can now seamlessly enter the blockchain space with confidence, especially with proven chains like Ethereum and now Solana.&nbsp;The fund demonstrates real-world practical use cases for blockchain beyond speculative investments. For many years, crypto investments were reserved for those brave enough to trade tokens directly or learn the intricacies of decentralized finance (DeFi).&nbsp;The latter was often a risk too far for their precious investments. Adding to this, ambiguous regulation meant that these options were completely off-limits for institutional fund managers like BlackRock.For years, crypto has been seeking the approval and legitimacy of traditional financial institutions. BUIDL isn&rsquo;t just acceptance; it&rsquo;s the green light for active participation from the world&rsquo;s biggest financial player. The fund&rsquo;s early success may be a potential catalyst for a swell of institutional investment as mainstream adoption grows. BUIDL&rsquo;s impact on traditional finance (TradFi) The BUIDL fund is a high-profile example of how traditional finance products can be improved with tokenization and blockchain.&nbsp;BUIDL demonstrates the design possibilities available to further tokenize money markets and RWAs.&ldquo;In the year since BUIDL&rsquo;s launch, we&rsquo;ve experienced significant growth in demand for tokenized real-world assets, reinforcing the value of offering institutional-grade products onchain,&rdquo; said Carlos Domingo, CEO and co-founder of Securitize, the company partnered with Blackrock to bring BUIDL onto the Solana blockchain. &ldquo;As the market for RWAs and tokenized treasuries gains momentum, expanding BUIDL to Solana &mdash; a blockchain known for its speed, scalability, and cost efficiency &mdash; is a natural next step.&rdquo;While the money market usually enables investors to earn yield from idle cash, traditional funds have trading limitations like limited operating hours. The introduction of blockchain versions gives 24-hour access and liquidity to investors.&nbsp;Blackrock isn&rsquo;t the only player in tokenized funds, either. Franklin Templeton released a similar blockchain product, which had grown to over a $600 billion market cap by February 2025, while Figure Markets launched an interest-bearing stablecoin called YLDS.Did you know? &nbsp;Beyond traditional institutions, BUIDL has drawn interest from blockchain-native entities eager to leverage its onchain utility. A standout early investor is Ondo Finance, which reallocated $95 million from its own tokenized short-term bond fund into BUIDL within a week of its March 2024 launch. Benefits of BUIDL for investors Traditional money market funds have been in operation for decades, but BUIDL introduces several benefits, including speed and accessibility, to bring these financial products into the modern world of digital assets.Improved speed and efficiency: With a BUIDL crypto investment, settlement times are reduced compared to traditional finance. This eases administrative burdens and costs while delivering overall operational efficiency.Enhanced liquidity and accessibility:&nbsp;Investors are able to buy and sell their fund tokens 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There are no closed trading times or weekends so investors can always retain liquidity to enjoy better capital efficiency.New yield generation:&nbsp;With BUIDL seeking a stable $1 value per token, investors get daily accrued dividends paid into wallets as new tokens on a monthly basis. This may provide higher returns compared to traditional fixed-income investments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Transparency and security:&nbsp;All of BUIDL&rsquo;s transactions and holdings are tokenized and registered on the relevant blockchains. This means everything is transparent for investors to enjoy more visibility and accountability of their assets. Risks and challenges of BUIDL BUIDL&rsquo;s rapid growth is a positive sign for innovation between TradFi and blockchain. Still, it also introduces risks that many investors might not be familiar with. This is an important consideration for money markets as factors like liquidity and technological vulnerabilities are evolving.&nbsp;Understanding these new elements is essential for investors:Liquidity issues: Liquidity is critical for any successful asset class, especially with derivative products. BUIDL does have some liquidity concerns with the investor base currently consisting of qualified investors, neglecting wide market adoption.Technical vulnerabilities: The foundation of BUIDL leverages Ethereum's smart contracting capabilities to tokenize US Treasurys. Smart contract vulnerabilities here could expose the fund to failures and hacks.&nbsp;Market manipulation: Cryptocurrency is notoriously volatile, often due to market manipulation as profiteers run tactics like wash trading and pump-and-dump schemes. As a new tokenized product, BUIDL could be vulnerable to this type of risk with its limited trading volumes and liquidity.&nbsp;Counterparty risk: Blackrock is a secure financial institution with credibility. But counterparty risk is significant in crypto. For instance, if an exchange listing BUIDL faces financial distress, it could impact the token's reliability.&nbsp;",

    "content": "US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner and vocal crypto critic Caroline Crenshaw has accused the US regulator of downplaying risks &lsquo;and misrepresenting the US stablecoin market in its newly published guidelines.However, many in the crypto industry see the new SEC guidelines &mdash; which say stablecoins that meet certain criteria are now considered \"non-securities\" and are exempt from transaction reporting requirements &mdash; as a step in the right direction.In an April 4 statement, Crenshaw, who is widely known for opposing the spot Bitcoin ETFs,&nbsp;said that the SEC's statement on stablecoins contained \"legal and factual errors that paint a distorted picture of the USD-stablecoin market that drastically understates its risks.\"Crenshaw disagrees, crypto industry applaudsCrenshaw disputed the accuracy of the analysis made by the SEC in arriving at that decision. She pushed back on the SEC for reiterating issuer actions \"that supposedly stabilize price, ensure redeemability, and otherwise reduce risk.\"Source: David SacksThe SEC said that \"albeit briefly, that some USD-stablecoins are available to retail purchasers only through an intermediary and not directly from the issuer.\"Crenshaw argued this was misleading. She said:\"It is the general rule, not the exception, that these coins are available to the retail public only through intermediaries who sell them on the secondary market, such as crypto trading platforms.\"\"Over 90% of USD-stablecoins in circulation are distributed in this way,\" Crenshaw added.Meanwhile, many in the crypto industry expressed optimism over the clearer guidance on stablecoins.Token Metrics founder Ian Ballina said it &ldquo;feels like a clear step in focusing on what really matters in the crypto space.&rdquo; Crypto industry says positive step, just lateVemanti CEO Tan Tran said he wished the SEC reached this point three years ago, while Midnight Network&rsquo;s head of partnerships Ian Kane said it &ldquo;feels like progress for crypto folks trying to play by the rules.&rdquo;Crenshaw said it is \"also grossly inaccurate\" for the SEC to reassure users that an issuer can handle unlimited redemptions just because its reserves match or exceed the value of the supply.Related: Stablecoins' in bull market'; Solana sputters: VanEck\"The issuer's overall financial health and solvency cannot be judged by the value of its reserve, which tells us nothing about its liabilities, risk from proprietary financial activities, and so forth,\" Crenshaw said.She explained that stablecoins always carry some risk, particularly during market downturns.It comes only weeks after stablecoin issuer Tether was reportedly engaging with a Big Four accounting firm to audit its assets reserve and verify that its USDT stablecoin is backed at a 1:1 ratio.On March 22, Cointelegraph reported that Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said the audit process would be more straightforward under pro-crypto US President Donald Trump.Magazine: XRP win leaves Ripple a 'bad actor' with no crypto legal precedent set",

    "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has no business with certain stablecoins or their issuers, the regulator's staff declared in the latest statement outlining the corners of the crypto sector for which it doesn't have a legal interest.Since the agency was taken over by President Donald Trump-appointed leadership and formed a Crypto Task Force to ease pressures on the digital assets space, its staff has issued a series of statements meant to clarify the crypto areas outside its jurisdiction — so far including memecoins and proof-of-work crypto mining. It's now added certain stablecoins to that list. The SEC's Division of Corporation Finance issued the Friday statement — not yet a binding rule, or even formal guidance — to declare such stablecoins \"do not involve the offer and sale of securities.\"\"Persons involved in the process of 'minting' (or creating) and redeeming Covered Stablecoins do not need to register those transactions with the Commission under the Securities Act or fall within one of the Securities Act’s exemptions from registration,\" according to the statement.It went on to clarify that such stablecoins — an arena dominated by Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC — \"are marketed solely for use in commerce, as a means of making payments, transmitting money, and/or storing value, and not as investments.\"However, the stablecoins covered by this statement may not include Tether's, because one of the footnotes says acceptable reserves \"do not include precious metals or other crypto assets,\" both of which are included in Tether's reserves. And the statement says any tokens must be redeemable at any time for dollars, but Tether's terms of service suggest minimum amounts or delays may be imposed. Circle President Heath Tarbert posted a social-media comment that included a jab toward its competitors. \"The SEC just drew a clear line: Stablecoins backed one-for-one with high quality liquid assets —l ike USDC — are NOT securities,\" Tarbert said. \"This certainty does not extend to other digital assets just because they call themselves 'stablecoins.'\"Congress has been moving forward on establishing a new set of U.S. standards for the issuance of such tokens. This week, the House Financial Services Committee advanced a stablecoin bill toward a vote of the overall House of Representatives. The Senate is building toward consideration of a similar bill that's also been approved by committee there — in both cases by a wide, bipartisan vote.While they're the most sedate of crypto assets, stablecoins have been a colorful political topic in recent weeks, as the Trump-backed World Liberty Financial pitched its own stablecoin, and some congressional Democrats are concerned that Elon Musk will leverage his status as a tech giant to follow suit.SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who is leading the agency's task force, has said she feels the early, nonbinding moves to reverse crypto resistance at the SEC are important and should be done as rapidly as possible, even if they're not yet official policy. She's said non-fungible tokens (NFTS) may also be considered for such a statement.

    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price has managed to stay above the $80,000 level as volatility wrecked US stock markets on April 3 and April 4. The failure of the bears to capitalize on the opportunity shows a lack of selling at lower levels.Risky assets were rattled after US President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on several countries on April 2. The fall in the US markets deepened on April 4 after China announced a retaliatory tariff of 34% on all imported US goods starting April 10.While several market participants are concerned about the near-term impact of tariffs, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said he loves tariffs since he expects them to be positive for Bitcoin and gold in the medium term.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360On the more cautious side was market commentator Byzantine General, who said in a post on X that the cryptocurrency market&rsquo;s upside would be limited due to possible tariff responses.&nbsp;Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards said in his analysis that Bitcoin would turn bullish on a break and close above $91,000. If that does not happen, he anticipates Bitcoin to fall to the $71,000 zone.Could Bitcoin outperform by staying above $80,000? Will the altcoins crumble? Let&rsquo;s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price analysisBitcoin rose above the resistance line on April 2, but the long wick on the candlestick shows solid selling at higher levels. The price turned down sharply and broke below the 20-day exponential moving average ($84,483).BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears will have to sink the price below the $80,000 support to strengthen their position. If they do that, the BTC/USDT pair could retest the March 11 low of $76,606. Buyers are expected to defend this level with all their might because a break and close below $76,606 could sink the pair to $73,777 and eventually to $67,000.The crucial resistance to watch out for on the upside is $88,500. A break and close above this level will signal that the corrective phase may be over. The pair could then start its journey toward $95,000.Ether price analysisEther (ETH) has been trading between the $1,754 support and the 20-day EMA ($1,928) for the past few days.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThat increases the likelihood of a break and close below $1,754. If sellers can pull it off, the ETH/USDT pair could start the next leg of the downtrend to $1,550.A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that the relative strength index (RSI) has formed a positive divergence. That suggests the bearish momentum may be weakening. If the price rebounds off $1,754, the pair could face selling at the 20-day EMA. However, if buyers overcome the obstacle, the pair could rally to $2,111. A short-term trend reversal will be signaled on a close above $2,111.XRP price analysisXRP (XRP) bears successfully defended the 20-day EMA ($2.23) on April 2 and pulled the price to the critical support at $2.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI below 44 increase the risk of a break below $2. If that happens, the XRP/USDT pair will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. The pair has support at $1.77, but if the level gets taken out, the decline could extend to $1.27.Buyers have an uphill task ahead of them if they want to prevent the breakdown. They will have to swiftly push the price above the 50-day simple moving average ($2.37) to clear the path for a relief rally to the resistance line.BNB price analysisBNB (BNB) bulls failed to push the price back above the moving averages in the past few days, indicating selling at higher levels.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe moving averages have started to turn down, and the RSI is in the negative zone, signaling a minor advantage for the bears. There is support at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $575 and next at the 61.8% retracement level of $559.On the upside, the bulls will have to push and maintain the price above the 50-day SMA ($614) to signal a comeback. The BNB/USDT pair may rise to $644, which is a critical overhead resistance to watch out for. If buyers overcome the barrier at $644, the pair may travel to $686.Solana price analysisSolana (SOL) rose above the 20-day EMA ($128) on April 2, but the bears sold at higher levels and pulled the price below the $120 support.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory heighten the risk of a break below $110. If that happens, the selling could intensify, and the SOL/USDT pair may plummet to $100 and subsequently to $80.The bulls are unlikely to give up easily and will try to keep the pair inside the $110 to $260 range. Buyers will have to push and maintain the price above $147 to suggest that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair may then ascend to $180.Dogecoin price analysisDogecoin (DOGE) bears thwarted attempts by the bulls to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.17) on April 2.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA positive sign in favor of the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to slide below the $0.16 support. A break above the 20-day EMA could push the price to the 50-day SMA ($0.19). Buyers will have to overcome the 50-day SMA to start a rally to $0.24 and later to $0.29.Alternatively, if the price turns down from the moving averages and breaks below $0.16, it will clear the path for a drop to $0.14. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $0.14 support because a break below it may sink the DOGE/USDT pair to $0.10.Cardano price analysisCardano (ADA) turned down sharply from the 20-day EMA ($0.69) on April 2 and closed below the uptrend line.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls are trying to push the price back above the uptrend line but are likely to face solid selling at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the ADA/USDT pair could descend to $0.58 and then to $0.50.This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up sharply and breaks above the 50-day SMA ($0.74). That opens the doors for a rally to $0.84, which may attract sellers.&nbsp;Related: Altcoins are set for one last big rally, but just a few will benefit &mdash; AnalystToncoin price analysisToncoin&rsquo;s (TON) failure to maintain above the $4.14 resistance on April 1 may have tempted short-term traders to book profits.TON/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe TON/USDT pair broke below the 20-day EMA ($3.65) on April 3, indicating that the bullish momentum is weakening. There is support at $3.32, but if the level cracks, the pair may drop to $2.81.Instead, if the price rebounds off $3.32, the pair could attempt to form a range in the near term. The pair could swing between $3.32 and $4.14 for some time. A break and close above $4.14 will signal that the downtrend may be over. The pair could then jump to $5.UNUS SED LEO price analysisUNUS SED LEO (LEO) bears pulled the price below the uptrend line on March 2 but could not sustain the lower levels. That suggests buying at lower levels.LEO/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($9.57) is turning down gradually, and the RSI is in the negative zone, signaling a slight advantage to the bears. If the price turns down from the moving averages, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the LEO/USD pair below the $8.84 support. If they succeed, the pair may tumble to $8.Contrarily, a break above the moving averages opens the doors for a rise to the overhead resistance of $9.90. If buyers pierce the $9.90 resistance, the pair will complete a bullish ascending triangle pattern. The pair may then climb toward the target objective of $12.04.Chainlink price analysisChainlink (LINK) once again turned down from the 20-day EMA ($13.98) on March 2, indicating that the bears continue selling on rallies.LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe LINK/USDT pair has strong support in the zone between $12 and the support line of the descending channel pattern. A rebound off the support zone will have to rise above the moving averages to signal a stronger recovery toward $17.50.Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will attempt to pull the price below the support line. If they can pull it off, the pair could extend the downtrend toward the crucial support at $10 and, after that, to $8.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Check out The Crunchbase Megadeals Board.\n\nThis is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out the biggest funding rounds of last week here.\n\nThis was a week right out of the free-spending days of 2021. Huge rounds were abundant — led by the biggest of them all as OpenAI’s massive $40 billion investment was finally announced.\n\n1. OpenAI, $40B, artificial intelligence: Of course the big news of the week was the $40 billion investment for OpenAI led by SoftBank. The deal is the biggest venture investment ever. Per details of the deal, SoftBank will build a syndicate of co-investors to provide $10 billion of the total, while it expects to fund the other $30 billion, with  $10 billion of that through debt. The deal also is partially contingent upon conditions of OpenAI’s restructuring of its for-profit subsidiary. If that occurs, OpenAI will have a post-money valuation of $300 billion.\n\n2. Plaid, $575M, fintech: Plaid raised a massive $575 million round led by Franklin Templeton at a $6.1 billion valuation. The San Francisco-based company plans to use the cash to pay employee tax withholding obligations related to share conversion and to offer some liquidity to employees via a tender offer. Plaid, which connects user bank accounts to fintech apps, had a planned $5.3 billion sale to Visa scrapped back in 2021 following regulatory issues.\n\n3. Silicon Ranch, $500M, energy: Nashville, Tennessee-based Silicon Ranch raised $500 million from European infrastructure investor AIP Management. The big investment is likely a bet on the U.S.’ increasing electricity demands. Silicon Ranch — which operates solar and battery projects — has been on this list before. Back in 2022, the company raised $775 million in equity capital led by Manulife Investment Management. Founded in 2011, the energy company has raised more than $2 billion, according to Crunchbase data.\n\n4. Runway, $308M, artificial intelligence: New York-based Runway raised $308 million in a new round at about double its valuation from less than two years ago. The new round — led by General Atlantic — values the AI video startup at more than $3 billion, per reports. In June 2023, the company raised a $141 million extension to its December 2022 $50 million Series C. Runway makes software that lets users create videos using text prompts or images. Earlier in the week, Runway unveiled its new AI model, Gen-4, that allows users to create videos with consistent characters and backgrounds. Last fall, the company signed a deal with production company LionsGate to create a customized video-generation model. The startup plans to use the fresh cash to develop AI focusing on its film and animation studio. Founded in 2018, it has raised more than $540 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n5. AIRNA, $155M, biotech: Cambridge, Massachusetts-based AIRNA, a biotech startup developing RNA editing therapeutics to help with both rare and common conditions, closed a $155 million Series B led by Forbion Capital Partners and Venrock Healthcare Capital Partners. The new cash will go toward launching a phase trial for AIRNA’s drug candidate for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and help it develop its pipeline of RNA editing therapeutics. Founded in 2021, the company has raised $245 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n6. (tied) Atsena Therapeutics, $150M, biotech: Atsena Therapeutics, a gene therapy company focused on reversing or preventing blindness, closed a $150 million Series C led by Bain Capital’s Life Sciences arm. The money from the financing will be used to advance the Durham, North Carolina-based company’s treatment of X-linked retinoschisis, a genetic condition that is typically diagnosed in childhood and leads to blindness later in life. The proceeds will also support Atsena’s preclinical pipeline. Founded in 2019, the company has raised nearly $238 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n6. (tied) SandboxAQ, $150M, quantum computing: Alphabet spinoff SandboxAQ — an AI and quantum computing startup — added another $150 million to its Series E from the likes Google and Nvidia. The add-on comes less than four months after the company announced it had raised a $300 million round at a $5.6 billion valuation. SandboxAQ is looking at the related effects of both AI and quantum — which is where the company gets “AQ” — to develop commercial products for telecom, financial services, health care, security and other computationally intensive sectors. The company already is working with a handful of customers on enterprise software and cybersecurity tools related to quantum computing. In March 2022, Alphabet officially spun off its 6-year-old quantum tech group — SandboxAQ — which emerged as its own company after closing a $500 million financing round and naming former Google CEO Eric Schmidt chairman. SandboxAQ has raised over $950 million, per the company.\n\n8. Temporal Technologies, $146M, software: Seattle-based Temporal Technologies locked up a big $146 million Series C at a $1.7 billion valuation led by Tiger Global Management. The company helps other companies manage complex software applications and will use the new cash to develop cloud products and invest in research and development for artificial intelligence use. The company raised a $103 million Series B in February 2022 at a valuation of a little more than $1.5 billion, followed by $75 million in a Series “B-Prime.” Founded in 2019, Temporal has raised $350 million, per the company.\n\n9. RayThera, $110M, biotech: San Diego-based RayThera, a biotechnology company currently focused on developing small molecule therapies in immunology, completed a $110 million Series A financing co-led by Foresite Capital and OrbiMed. This is the company’s first raise, per Crunchbase.\n\n10. Neurona Therapeutics, $102M, biotech: Neurona Therapeutics, a South San Francisco-based clinical-stage biotech company developing regenerative cell therapies for disorders of the nervous system, raised a $102 million financing round. Investors included Fidelity Management & Research Co. Founded in 2008, the company has raised $426 million, per Crunchbase.\nBig global deals\n\nThe biggest raise this week came from across the pond.\n\nGoogle spinoff Isomorphic Labs raised $600 million in its first external funding round as the company looks to apply artificial intelligence to the drug development process. The new round was led by Thrive Capital with participation from Google Ventures. The London-based AI company will receive follow-on capital from existing investor Alphabet.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of March 29 to April 4. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

    "title": "Circle’s IPO Filing Tests Crypto Market Confidence After Trump’s Tariff Shock",
    "content": "After U.S. President Donald Trump’s reelection in November, optimism surged among crypto companies eyeing the public markets. Trump floated big promises: clearer rules for the industry and ambitions to make America the crypto capital of the world.For a moment, it looked like the floodgates might open. IPO pipelines buzzed with activity. Founders dreamed of ringing the opening bell. But beneath the surface, storm clouds were gathering. A bull market is the lifeblood of successful listings, and few foresaw just how rocky the road ahead would become.Circle didn’t wait for perfect conditions. After years of false starts and regulatory hangups, the stablecoin issuer finally filed its S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, taking a long-delayed step toward becoming a publicly traded company.The filing landed with a mix of energy and doubt. Some in the industry saw it as a bullish signal—another crypto heavyweight inching closer to the public markets. Others questioned the timing. Markets remain shaky, and Circle’s path to a successful debut is far from guaranteed.\"I believe Circle will be able to price their IPO and raise capital, however it isn't going to be easy,” said David Pakman, managing partner and head of venture investments at CoinFund. “Generally, companies going public would like to debut during strong equity markets.”Equities have been in a free fall since Trump announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on about 90 U.S. trade partners, including China and the European Union, deepening fears of a global recession. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have dipped 11% and 17% year-to-date, respectively, marking one of the worst quarters in recent years.As a result, cloud computing firm CloudWeave, which went public last month, saw a disappointing debut, even though the stock rebounded on the second day of trading as investor demand for artificial intelligence companies appears to be stronger than short-term anxiety in markets. Payments app Klarna said it paused its IPO plan earlier today.But Circle doesn’t just face broader market jitters as a potential threat to its IPO. Analysts have pointed out the company’s financials, which could make it difficult to attract investors.“While I personally have tremendous respect and appreciation for Circle and their leadership, their financials show the challenges they have faced with growth and the high cost of their distribution partnerships,” Pakman, who noted that he still believes long-term value of the company, said.Circle’s IPO filing revealed shrinking gross margins and high spending, which comes at a time when clearer stablecoin regulation could bring increased competition to the market.“Circle is currently being priced like a traditional crypto business — cyclical, interest rate-dependent, and not diversified enough. If Circle can evolve to look more like a payments network with high margins and strong moats, its valuation might reflect that,” Lorenzo Valente, a crypto analyst at ARK Invest, wrote in a post on X.Many aspects about the company’s structure seem to be in question, including how its revenue-sharing agreement will evolve, as well as the growth of Base, the blockchain created by Coinbase that uses Circle’s USDC, according to Valente.“One precaution Circle has taken is a lower valuation. But, still hurdles remain as the rollout and implementation of digital rails in the banking system will take time,” said Mark Connors, chief investment strategist at Risk Dimensions, a New York-based Bitcoin investment advisory.Circle’s rumored valuation of $4 billion to $6 billion, roughly 13 to 20 times its adjusted EBITDA, is in line with Coinbase and Block, and “not necessarily cheap, especially considering its recent drop in profitability,” Valente said.“We do like the prospect for the growth in US-backed stablecoins based on the growing commercial use, shift in U.S. the regulatory and legislative (GENIUS Act) winds and the U.S. Treasury’s incentive to find new buyers of its growing stack of U.S. T-Bills,” according to Connors.Over $6 trillion of Treasury bills will be rolled over this year, with additional issuance likely to fund the still-growing U.S. deficit.Despite market uncertainty about the remaining year, several other crypto natives are looking to fulfill their IPO dreams, including Kraken, Gemini, Blockchain.com, Bullish (the parent company of CoinDesk) and BitGo. Even more crypto firms are rumored to be in talks to go public as well.However, others will likely put their IPO plans on hold as they wait for regulatory clarity and better market conditions. Analysts at crypto M&A advisory firm Architect Partners expect the majority of IPOs to be filed in the second half of 2025 after written regulations and policies are clearly completed.",

    "content": "When Ethereum’s hottest startup of last year, EigenLayer, launched a year ago to massive expectations — many community members were quick to criticize that it was lacking a critical feature.An announcement from the project on Wednesday said that the feature — slashing — is finally set to arrive on April 17. The introduction of slashing will mark the first \"feature complete\" version of the protocol.EigenLayer pioneered the concept of restaking, a way for Ethereum users to secure additional protocols beyond the base layer by recommitting their staked Ether. Slashing was supposed to be a core part of this system, providing apps a way to punish bad actors by seizing a portion of their capital.The implementation of slashing will allow Actively Validated Services (AVSs) — apps built atop EigenLayer's restaking system — to set custom conditions penalizing operators who fail to meet pre-established conditions and rewarding those who do.\"This is a major step forward in the EigenLayer protocol because it allows for a free marketplace where Operators can earn rewards for their work and AVSs can launch verifiable services,\" EigenLayer said in a blog post.EigenLayer attracted more than $15 billion to the platform within a year and generated massive hype for the EIGEN token, which launched in October.EigenLayer’s ecosystem has been expanding, with \"100+\" AVSs in development, according to its website. Notable services include EigenDA, a data availability service operated by Eigen Labs, and ARPA Network, which specializes in trustless randomization.While EigenLayer pioneered restaking, the lack of slashing left room for competitors to gain market share. Symbiotic, which allows for the restaking of any asset, has been used by EigenLayer early adopters including Hyperlane, an interoperability framework, and Ethena, a popular synthetic dollar protocol.Read more: EigenLayer, Crypto's Biggest Project Launch This Year, Is Still Missing Crucial Functionality",

    "content": "It was a dreadful week for the stock market, with the S&P 500 falling more than 6% over the last five days. That didn’t help Bitcoin, but the original cryptocurrency fared better than the wider market, rising over 1% in the same period.The Nasdaq had one of its largest falls in 25 years Thursday, but bitcoin held relatively steady (CoinDesk’s James Van Straten reported) even if now it’s nowhere near the highs above 100,000 that we saw at the beginning of the year.The big question for bitcoin amid market uncertainty is whether it’s seen as a risk asset to be sold off in a storm or a safe haven akin to gold (which until the last 24 hours at least was doing well relative to the market). The impact of tariffs on crypto is much debated by researchers. Meanwhile, the digital assets industry prepared for better days ahead. Circle — the issuer of the second largest stablecoin, USDC — officially filed for an IPO. An important U.S. House committee advanced its stablecoin bill, with significant Democrat support.Fidelity Investments, a major brokerage firm, announced plans to offer an IRA allowing investors direct access to crypto in their retirement accounts. Helene Braun had the news. Advisers are increasingly willing to promote crypto products to their clients, surveys show. In other news, corporate bitcoin buyers, like Strategy, Metaplanet, Mara and Tether, kept stockpiling bitcoin, taking advantage of today’s prices. Ethereum developers locked in May 7 for their next upgrade (named Pectra), Margaux Nijkerk reported. Ripple reported big demand for its new stablecoin RLUSD, Kris Sandor reported.Then in regulatory news, Paul Atkins neared confirmation for SEC Chair and long-time D.C. crypto advocate stepped down from heading the Blockchain Association to work for a new Solana-focused group. Much of the news followed a pattern we’ve seen for the last few weeks: Sagging markets and quiet industry growth aided by a regulatory thaw.Given the tumultuous macroeconomic environment, it’s going to be fascinating to see how crypto continues to fare.",

    "title": "Crypto-to-Fiat App P2P.me Raises $2M from Multicoin and Coinbase Ventures",
    "content": "Bitcoin's original promise of \"peer-to-peer electronic cash\" hasn't exactly developed in the way Satoshi intended. More people than ever are eager to pay in crypto, while most vendors want nothing but fiat.While the mismatch has plenty of workarounds in countries with a strong banking and credit card culture, it's a real problem in places with alternative electronic payment rails, like QR codes, says pseudonymous crypto developer Sheldon Cooper. How can one scan a fiat-only code and pay in stablecoins?Cooper's claimed solution, P2P.me, does it without ever touching the regular on-and-off ramps. Instead, this blockchain-based service relies on a network of middlemen willing to accept USDC from, say, Alice and send the equivalent fiat along to Bob. The whole process takes about 90 seconds, he said.There are no traditional identity checks, either. P2P.me vets its users with zero-knowledge proofs that checks for a real-seeming social media presence and maybe even for a government ID. But it doesn't store this personal data as would most financial institutions from banks on down to Binance.\"What we thought about is, 'How do we decentralize this? How do we do on and off rams in a decentralized way,'\" said Cooper. \"The number one concern is privacy and self custody. All these CEXes give data to the government.\"P2P.me's quirky blend of permissionless markets and privacy tech has processed $1.6 million in payments from around 1,100 users, mostly in Indonesia, Nigeria and Vietnam. That modest amount, quickly growing, was enough to get venture capitalists' interest: Multicoin Capital and Coinbase Ventures recently invested $2 million P2P.me's seed round.The money's already helped P2P.me scale its team to 20 people ahead of a planned push into Latin America, Cooper said. He sees local communities that struggle to navigate established financial rails as key adopters. So too are crypto-savvy tourists who go places where their credit cards don't work, but their cell phones do.Built on Base, the open protocol plans to launch a token in the next 12 months that will shift control to the community, according to Cooper.\"The strategic idea of the token is to scale globally, to break the network effects of the centralized exchange with P2P,\" he said.",

    "content": "Gold-backed cryptocurrencies like Paxos Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUT) retreated from record highs on Friday amid a global financial-markets sell-off that erased $2.5 trillion from U.S. equities alone in a single day after U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariffs.The tokens, which are backed by physical gold and track its price, initially rallied as investors sought shelter from the uncertainty the tariffs introduced. Gold is usually seen as a haven investment, but large-scale losses in equity markets often force investors to liquidate safer assets to cover margin calls and cash out losses.PAXG climbed to an all-time high of $3,191 with XAUT following closely behind to reach $3,190, exceeding spot gold’s peak of $3,167. The initial rise didn’t last, with PAXG dropping to $3,074 and XAUT to $3,064, mirroring gold's pullback to $3,038 per ounce.The tariffs announced on Wednesday spooked markets with their breadth and unclear targets. Investors, already jittery from a volatile global outlook, responded swiftly. The S&P 500 posted one of its steepest drops since the COVID-era panic in 2020 on Thursday, while the Nasdaq 100 saw its worst single-day point loss in history according to the Kobeissi Letter. The rout extended into a second day, with the MSCI World Index dropping 4.3% on Friday after losing 3.7% on Thursday.Still, gold-backed tokens remain 17% higher since the start of the year. The rally has been driven by Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, sustained demand from Asia and a wave of central bank buying earlier in the year. In February, central banks reported net gold purchases of 24 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council.Poland led the pack, adding 29 tons and bringing its total reserves to 480 tons, now 20% of its foreign exchange holdings. China, Turkey, Jordan, and Qatar also increased their holdings.",

    "title": "Two Roads Diverged: Choosing the Right Path on Stablecoin Legislation",
    "content": "In the early-1990s, telephone companies ran ads for long distance calls highlighting the cost per minute for a U.S. customer to speak to someone in another country. Today, that business does not exist. You can now Facetime or Zoom anyone, anywhere, for free.What changed?The shift to Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) ultimately drove the price of calls down to nearly zero.Today, we are experiencing a similar transformation as a global, embedded financial layer emerges within the internet. This will ultimately drive money transfer costs closer to zero, transforming a system long burdened by high fees, delays and middlemen.Stablecoins are the application driving this evolution. The maxim “adoption is slow until it is fast” captures their explosive growth in recent years. To get an idea of scale, stablecoin transaction volume surged above $27 trillion in 2024 – surpassing Visa and Mastercard combined. Today, there are stablecoin providers, such as Tether, that hold more U.S. Treasuries than entire countries like Germany and the Netherlands.Stablecoins are no longer a niche experiment. They are becoming more deeply embedded in our global financial ecosystem. As U.S. lawmakers debate stablecoin legislation, the goal should be clear: reinforce the dollar’s dominance as the global reserve currency while extending its reach into corners of the world that traditional banking cannot touch. This should include many important players — not just those based in the United States.Two Paths, One FutureCongress is at a crossroads between two general positions. One is a closed-market approach in which U.S.-based stablecoin issuers would be privileged over their non-U.S. competitors. This is shortsighted and will ultimately stifle innovation.The other approach is to build a regulatory framework that cultivates fair and free global competition. By allowing international players like Tether to compete alongside U.S.-based issuers, the U.S. can foster a dynamic ecosystem where the best ideas and technologies rise to the top. Competition is what would drive excellence.There is a myth being perpetrated that only U.S.-based issuers back their tokens with sufficient reserves, attest to those reserves, and take necessary steps to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. That simply is not true. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, assisted American law enforcement and over 230 law enforcement agencies in 50 countries to block $2.5 billion dollars in illicit activities worldwide. The reality is that responsible stablecoin issuers exist both inside and outside the U.S. (Tether, which is based in El Salvador, accounts for more than half the stablecoin market.)Overly restrictive regulation could also backfire on the U.S. economy. If stablecoin legislation drives foreign-based companies out of the U.S., it could result in decreased demand for U.S. Treasuries, weakened dollar dominance and a less competitive stablecoin space.Congress stands at an important crossroads — “two roads diverged” as Robert Frost once wrote. It could seize this moment to craft a regulatory framework that champions competition and transparency, or it could take the narrow road by taking a protectionist approach and choking innovation. The market’s diversity is not a bug to fix. It’s a feature to harness.It's time to make a careful choice as the stakes could not be higher. Let's make sure we get this right for the future of finance.",

    "content": "Riot Platforms (RIOT) reported strong operational performance in March 2025, highlighted by continued expansion into the artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) sector. The company's bitcoin (BTC) production last month rose to 533 BTC, the most since the reward halving almost a year ago. The figure represents a month-on-month increase of 13% and 25% more than a year before. Bitcoin holdings grew to 19,223 BTC.Riot said it plans to \"aggressively pursue\" development of its Corsicana facility to capitalize on rising demand for compute infrastructure used in AI and HPC. A recently completed feasibility study by industry consultant Altman Solon confirmed the significant potential of the site to support up to 600 megawatts of additional capacity for AI/HPC applications. Key advantages include 1.0 gigawatt of secured power, 400 MW of which is already operational, 265 acres of land with substantial development potential and close proximity to Dallas — a major hub for AI and cloud computing. The study noted the site’s ability to support both inference and cloud-based workloads, strengthening its appeal to AI/HPC tenants. Riot maintained a steady deployed hash rate of 33.7 EH/s, while its average operating hash rate grew 3% month-over-month to 30.3 EH/s—representing a 254% increase year-over-year. Although power credits declined due to seasonal factors, Riot kept its all-in power cost low at 3.8 cents per kWh, and improved fleet efficiency to 21.0 J/TH, a 22% improvement from the previous year. Riot’s shares fell 5.5% Friday, while the Nasdaq 100 index dropped 2.8%.

    "title": "A Blueprint for Digital Assets in America",
    "content": "In 2008, an anonymous person or group of people known only as “Satoshi Nakamoto” released a now-seminal document, the Bitcoin White paper, introducing a peer-to-peer system for value of exchange without intermediaries.With this revolutionary concept, the idea of a “digital asset” was born. Soon after, developers and entrepreneurs expanded on this concept, developing systems where value was exchanged not just for its own sake, but for services and digital products.Over the past decade, innovators have built permissionless, decentralized networks for computing services, file storage, asset exchange, cellular coverage, Wi-Fi connectivity, mapping tools, lending services, and more. Because digital assets can be used for services that anyone can offer and anyone can access, the use-cases – both financial and non-financial – are potentially endless.Despite this promise, these networks have courted criticism. The Biden-Harris Administration attempted to block this innovative advance through a relentless campaign of lawsuits and enforcement actions without providing the regulatory clarity the digital asset ecosystem and its innovators and users so desperately needed.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) failed to clarify how existing securities laws apply and — more importantly — don’t apply to digital asset transactions. This lack of regulatory clarity stifled the digital asset ecosystem, pushing growth out of the United States to jurisdictions that have established clear rules of the road.To address these failures, Congress began exploring ways to modernize the regulatory structure to accommodate the unique characteristics of digital assets and how they could be used in our financial system. These efforts culminated in a series of bills aimed at clarifying how digital assets could be used in the financial system, ensuring investor protection and fostering innovation.In the 118th Congress, the House Committees on Financial Services and Agriculture launched a historic joint effort to address digital asset regulation. This led to the first-ever passage of bipartisan digital asset market structure legislation in a chamber of Congress. This collaboration enabled Congress to address longstanding challenges in the ecosystem and lay the foundation for a fit for purpose framework under the leadership of President Trump.This Congress, both the House and Senate are committed to creating a clear path forward for the digital asset ecosystem. As we move ahead, it is crucial that the framework is both balanced and iron-clad for the future. To accomplish this, we have set out principles for digital asset legislation.Six principlesFirst, legislation must promote innovation. We seek to protect opportunities for innovators to create and utilize digital assets, while ensuring users can lawfully transact with one another.Second, legislation must provide clarity for the classification of assets. Users of digital assets should clearly understand the nature of their holdings, including whether they qualify as securities or non-securities.Third, legislation must codify a framework for the issuance of new digital assets. The framework should permit issuers to raise capital through the sale of new digital assets under the jurisdiction of the SEC. It should protect retail investors and require developers to disclose relevant information to help users understand the unique characteristics of digital asset networks.Fourth, the legislation must establish the regulation of spot market exchanges and intermediaries. Centralized, custodial exchanges and intermediaries facilitating transactions with non-security digital assets should adhere to similar requirements as other financial firms.Congress should provide the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with the authority to impose requirements over these entities necessary to protect customers, limit conflicts of interest, ensure appropriate execution of customer orders, and provide disclosures.Fifth, the legislation must establish best practices for the protection of customer assets. Entities registered with the SEC or CFTC should be required to segregate customer funds and hold them with qualified custodians. Customer funds should also be protected during bankruptcy.Sixth, and finally, the legislation must protect innovative decentralized projects and activities. Congress should ensure that decentralized protocols, which pose different risks and benefits, are not subject to regulations designed for centralized, custodial firms. In safeguarding decentralized activities, Congress must also protect an individual’s right to self-custody their digital assets.We look forward to both Committees continuing our legislative work together to fulfill President Trump’s request to make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” In May, our Committees will host our second joint hearing to discuss digital asset market structure legislation.Our goal is to bring much-needed regulatory clarity to this rapidly evolving industry, ensuring that America continues to lead in shaping the future of digital finance.",

    "content": "Ryan Cohen, the chairman and CEO of video retailer GameStop (GME), increased his stake in the company following the firm's decision to add bitcoin (BTC) as a treasury reserve asset.According to a Thursday filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Cohen acquired an additional 500,000 shares of the company's Class A common stock at $21.55 per share, totaling approximately $10.78 million. This purchase elevates Cohen's total holdings to 37,347,842 shares, representing about 8.4% of GameStop's outstanding shares, the filing shows.Cohen's purchase comes on the heels of GameStop's board approving a plan in late March to invest part of its cash pile in bitcoin. The firm also issued $1.5 billion in convertible notes to raise funds for its BTC acquisition plan. That capital raise closed earlier this week. GME shares are slightly up premarket trading after falling over 7% on Thursday as U.S. stocks plunged in reaction to President Trump's tariff announcements.",

    "content": "The Cardano Foundation has rolled out Veridian, a new open-source platform aimed at helping people and businesses manage their digital identities, according to a Friday release.Alongside it comes the Veridian Wallet, a tool designed to keep personal info secure and let users prove who they are online without the usual hassles of sharing sensitive data.This launch comes at a time when proving one’s identity online is more important and riskier than ever. Whether it’s for healthcare, banking, shipping, or school records, current systems often leave data exposed, and with smart devices and AI popping up everywhere, those flaws are getting tougher to fix, the Foundation said.“From healthcare and financial services to supply chains and academics, identity verification serves as the cornerstone of trust,” Thomas A. Mayfield, head of Decentralized Trust and Identity Solutions at Cardano Foundation, wrote in the release. “Despite this, existing solutions often fail to provide adequate security and credential control, resulting in frequent data breaches. Last year alone, 1.7 billion records were compromised in the United States.”Veridian tackles this by letting users take control instead of handing their information to a central authority. It uses open, shared tools to ensure legitimate communication and check identities without a go-between.There’s even an option to link it to the Cardano blockchain for added assurance. The Veridian Wallet ties it all together, letting people manage their details safely from their phones.The wallet application is built for individuals and businesses alike, with options for companies to tweak it for their needs.Read more: Cardano: Deep Dive on the Trump Reserve Token Whose Blockchain Ignores TVL",

    "content": "The U.S. employment situation continued to roll along in strong fashion in March, adding another piece to the puzzle as the Federal Reserve contemplates the path of short-term interest rates in a world that's markedly changed in the last 48 hours.Nonfarm payrolls rose by 228,000 last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday morning. Economists had expected a gain of just 135,000 following February’s increase of 117,000 jobs (revised from an originally reported 151,000).The unemployment rate for March, however, rose a tick to 4.2% against economist consensus of 4.1% and February's 4.1%.The price of bitcoin (BTC) was little-changed in the minutes following the report at $82,600.Ahead of the jobs report, the CME FedWatch Tool — which gauges market expectations for Federal Reserve policy — had priced in four rate cuts for 2025, which would bring the federal funds rate down to a target range of 3.25%–3.50%. While the Fed is still expected to hold rates steady at its May meeting, market participants are increasingly betting on a cut in June, with current odds showing a 60% probability.All this comes, of course, as Trump's Wednesday evening tariff announcements threw markets into an historic tizzy. The Nasdaq plunged 6% on Thursday and the S&P 500 just shy of 5%. Hopes for some sort of Friday bounce were dashed a few hours ago when China announced retaliatory tariffs. Prior to the jobs data, Nasdaq and S&P futures were pointing to opening declines of around 3%.Bitcoin added to list of safe havens?To no surprise, gold is among the assets where investors have been hiding out. Though it's down a bit since the tariff announcement, it remains very close to its record high of around $3,200 per ounce. Also to no surprise, U.S. Treasury bonds have seen a strong bid, with the yield on the 10-year tumbling to 3.89% just ahead of this morning's jobs news, now lower by nearly 100 basis points since President Trump's inauguration. Bitcoin bulls may have been disappointed by the crypto's behavior over the past weeks, with the price seemingly moving tick for tick with the struggling Nasdaq. Signs of a decoupling may be emerging though. Bitcoin on Thursday managed to hold the $80,000 level even as the Nasdaq tumbled throughout the day. Prior to this morning's numbers, BTC was roughly flat in the $82,000 area even as futures pointed to a continuation of the Nasdaq plunge.Next up is March inflation data to be reported next week, with both core and headline CPI still seen hovering around 3%.",

    "content": "Since the start of April, bitcoin (BTC) has experienced an unusual increase in conviction from both short-term and long-term holders. According to Glassnode, short-term holders—those who have held bitcoin for less than 155 days—are typically more reactive to price movements, often buying during periods of euphoria and selling during downturns. However, of late, short-term holders appear to have become value-driven buyers despite bitcoin currently sitting roughly 25% below its all-time high.Since the start of April, this group has grown by around 15,000 BTC, now holding a total of just over 3.7 million BTC. That said, since February, they have distributed approximately 280,000 BTC—likely a mix of profit-taking from the November–December rally, which followed President Donald Trump’s election win. That's in addition to panic selling during bitcoin's 30% drawdown from its January all-time high. Long-term holders—those who have held for at least 155 days – have boosted their coin stash by 400,000 BTC since February, with small amounts acquired this month, taking the overall tally to over 13.5 million. This suggests growing conviction among long-term holders, even amid recent price stagnation. While bitcoin has remained relatively flat since the start of April, Nasdaq is down 3.5% in the same time frame, with futures pointing to a further 3% decline.",

    "title": "The Great Venture Talent Flux",
    "content": "By Rohit Yadav \n\nWhen is the right moment to shift your company, your role, or even your entire industry?\n\nAsk a dozen people, and you’ll get a dozen different answers. But in venture capital, one thing is clear: we are at the peak of a talent shake-up.\nThe breaking point: 2023-24\nRohit Yadav\n\nLet’s rewind. The bottom of the venture cycle hit in 2023, a year that didn’t just hit valuations and deal flow but also put immense pressure on VC talent.\n\nThe downturn led to frustration, misalignment and career soul-searching. For some, it was a breaking point. For others, a wake-up call.\n\nEither way, it set the stage for one of the most dramatic talent shifts the industry has seen.\n\nWhat fueled this movement? Many factors, among them:\n\n The urge to break free: Many investors are, at their core, entrepreneurs. Some saw 2023 as a catalyst to launch their own firms rather than compete in an overcrowded system.\n Deal flow freeze: A risk-off dealmaking environment left many VCs unable to deploy capital, grow or build their track records, leading to frustration and career stagnation.\n The mega-firm misfit: Large firms often have hierarchies that might stifle rising stars, pushing ambitious partners to carve their paths. Meanwhile, the industry’s shift toward asset management (and away from high-risk, high-reward investing) deepened doubts about staying.\n Burnout and toxicity: Talk of toxic leadership and unhealthy work environments had long existed, but 2023 amplified these frustrations. Some couldn’t ignore internal conflicts and personal challenges anymore.\n Shifting career lanes: Not all VCs fully appreciated their roles. Many started exploring complementary paths, often eyeing operational roles where they could make a more tangible impact.\n Fundraising crunch: Raising capital became an uphill battle as LPs pulled back. With fewer opportunities to grow within, some reconsidered their long-term trajectories.\n AI disruption: The rapid ascent of AI forced firms to reassess their positioning, while some investors jumped ship to chase AI-driven opportunities that their firms weren’t ready — or willing — to embrace.\n The generational shift: For veteran investors, this downturn became a moment of reflection. Some saw it as a natural exit point rather than riding out another decade-plus cycle.\n\nDespite hopes for a rebound, the venture market didn’t reignite in 2024. Recovery was sluggish, and momentum was weak. But one shift was impossible to ignore: VC talent was on the move. What once simmered in the background was now front and center, reshaping the industry in real-time.\nThe talent movement snapshot\n\nCareer moves, like life, aren’t linear. Many of the shifts we saw in the past few quarters might have been brewing for months or even years, and we may never know the real reasons behind every move.\n\nA few notable recent VC moves include Sam Blond of Founder’s Fund, who transitioned from investing to an operational role, while Miles Grimshaw returned to Thrive from Benchmark, and Keith Rabois boomeranged back to Khosla Ventures.\n\nThe urge to build new firms also seemed to accelerate:\n\nMichael Gilroy (ex-Coatue) launched MarathonMP with Gokul Rajaram;\nBilal Zuberi (ex-Lux Capital) started work on a new fund; and\nAnu Hariharan (ex-Y Combinator) forged her path.\n\nOthers had to adapt. Greycroft cut five investors after missing its fundraising goal by 40%, Octopus Ventures laid off 16% of its investment team, and Initialized Capital restructured.\n\nIn Europe, Cavalry Ventures lost its third partner in 2024, while Judith Dada (who left General Catalyst in 2023) moved to Visionaries Club in 2025.\n\nEarly-stage VC also saw notable moves, including Amanda Robson (ex-Cowboy Ventures 1) and Vic Singh (ex-Eniac Ventures) both setting out to start new firms.\nSo, what about 2025?\n\nCareer-defining decisions happen in two key moments: under extreme pressure (like 2023-24) or during peak market euphoria (like 2020-21). Outside these cycles, most stay put. But the last market descent triggered a talent reshuffling that’s still unfolding.\n\nThe best part? There’s still time. This year marks an inflection point. With nine months left, the venture landscape is still in flux but far more optimistic than in 2023-24. This is a rare moment to take control, realign ambitions, reignite networks and embrace reinvention. One thing is clear: The hunger for transformation has never been stronger.\n\nThis year will be defined by bold pivots and quiet recalibrations. Some will take the leap, others will strategically position themselves for moves in the coming quarters and years.\n\nAnd for junior and mid-level VC talent? The opportunity is even bigger. With pressure easing and partner-level transitions reshaping firms, hiring is regaining focus. Now is the time to step up, claim new roles and make bold career moves.\n\nOne thing is undeniable — venture talent is on the move.

    "content": "Editor’s note: For more Web3 coverage, visit Crunchbase’s Web3 Tracker, where we track startups, investors and funding news in the Web3, cryptocurrency and blockchain space, powered by Crunchbase’s live, comprehensive data.\n\nVenture funding to crypto and blockchain startups more than doubled in the first quarter as crypto enthusiasts seem ready to embrace easing regulations.\n\nHowever, the total dollar figures were heavily skewed by a large $2 billion raise by a crypto exchange with ties to White House.\n\nOverall, venture funding to startups in the crypto and blockchain space — also called Web3 for our purposes here — rocketed to $3.8 billion in 220 deals in Q1, per Crunchbase data. The dollar figure represents a 138% jump from the previous quarter, which saw only $1.6 billion go to Web3 startups in 242 deals.\n\nIt also represents about twice the amount of cash such startups raised in Q1 2024.\nA deeper look\n\nHowever, before any grand announcements of a crypto rebound are made aloud, a deeper look at the numbers shows that that dollar figure was propped up by one big round.\n\nLast month, cryptocurrency exchange Binance received a massive $2 billion investment from Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX. The deal is the single largest investment into a crypto company, beating out FTX’s $1 billion Series B and NYDIG’s $1 billion private equity round in 2021 — both deals raised during the salad days of venture and crypto.\n\nSetting that round aside, Web3 startups raised $1.8 billion last quarter — similar to Q3 and Q4 last year and less than Q2 2024.\n\nDeal flow also continues to shrink, with Q1 seeing fewer than half the number of deals closed during the same quarter a year ago.\n\nThat’s not to say there were not some large deals. San Francisco-based Phantom, a crypto wallet startup, raised a $150 million round led by Paradigm and Sequoia Capital that valued the startup at $3 billion, and Paris-based Flowdesk, a crypto-financial service company building a trading infrastructure, raised a $91.8 million venture round.\nRocky market\n\nThe new White House has energized the Web3 environment — especially in crypto. President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve, and most expect regulation in the crypto industry to ease up substantially under his administration.\n\nHowever, that has not translated into price jumps in the market. Bitcoin was down 9% in Q1, while Ether tumbled 43%.\n\nIronically, the White House may also soon have ties to the newly funded Binance, which pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering laws in 2023. The same day that round was announced it was reported President Trump’s family may take a financial stake in the company, according to The Wall Street Journal. Also that same day, Bloomberg reported that Trump-linked crypto bank World Liberty Financial is in talks with Binance to launch a dollar-pegged stablecoin.\n\nDespite some starts and stops for Web3 in general and crypto in particular, it seems like there is mounting momentum. Some crypto firms even seem to be ready to jump into the tepid IPO waters. Stablecoin issuer Circle filed this week for an offering, and eToro, which operates a trading platform for stocks, cryptocurrencies and other assets, filed for an IPO last month.\n\nInvestors likely will watch those offerings closely as the Web3 sector continues its ups and downs.\nMethodology\n\nFor Web3 funding numbers, we analyze investments made into VC-backed startups in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry group.\nRelated Crunchbase Pro list:\n\nFunding To VC-Backed Web3 Startups\n\nRelated reading:\n\nCrypto Giant Binance Scoops Up $2B From Abu Dhabi’s MGX\nExcitement Builds Around Web3 And Crypto, But VC Dollars Don’t Follow\nWeb3 Funding Gains 43% Year To Year But Dips From Q2\nPublic Raises $135M Series D-2 For AI-Driven Investment\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

    "content": "Agents are the talk of the AI industry—they’re capable of planning, reasoning, and executing complex tasks like scheduling meetings, ordering groceries, or even taking over your computer to change settings on your behalf. But the same sophisticated abilities that make agents helpful assistants could also make them powerful tools for conducting cyberattacks. They could readily be used to identify vulnerable targets, hijack their systems, and steal valuable data from unsuspecting victims. \n\nAt present, cybercriminals are not deploying AI agents to hack at scale. But researchers have demonstrated that agents are capable of executing complex attacks (Anthropic, for example, observed its Claude LLM successfully replicating an attack designed to steal sensitive information), and cybersecurity experts warn that we should expect to start seeing these types of attacks spilling over into the real world.\n\n“I think ultimately we’re going to live in a world where the majority of cyberattacks are carried out by agents,” says Mark Stockley, a security expert at the cybersecurity company Malwarebytes. “It’s really only a question of how quickly we get there.”\n\nWhile we have a good sense of the kinds of threats AI agents could present to cybersecurity, what’s less clear is how to detect them in the real world. The AI research organization Palisade Research has built a system called LLM Agent Honeypot in the hopes of doing exactly this. It has set up vulnerable servers that masquerade as sites for valuable government and military information to attract and try to catch AI agents attempting to hack in.\n\nThe team behind it hopes that by tracking these attempts in the real world, the project will act as an early warning system and help experts develop effective defenses against AI threat actors by the time they become a serious issue.\n\n“Our intention was to try and ground the theoretical concerns people have,” says Dmitrii Volkov, research lead at Palisade. “We’re looking out for a sharp uptick, and when that happens, we’ll know that the security landscape has changed. In the next few years, I expect to see autonomous hacking agents being told: ‘This is your target. Go and hack it.’”\n\nAI agents represent an attractive prospect to cybercriminals. They’re much cheaper than hiring the services of professional hackers and could orchestrate attacks more quickly and at a far larger scale than humans could. While cybersecurity experts believe that ransomware attacks—the most lucrative kind—are relatively rare because they require considerable human expertise, those attacks could be outsourced to agents in the future, says Stockley. “If you can delegate the work of target selection to an agent, then suddenly you can scale ransomware in a way that just isn’t possible at the moment,” he says. “If I can reproduce it once, then it’s just a matter of money for me to reproduce it 100 times.”\n\nAgents are also significantly smarter than the kinds of bots that are typically used to hack into systems. Bots are simple automated programs that run through scripts, so they struggle to adapt to unexpected scenarios. Agents, on the other hand, are able not only to adapt the way they engage with a hacking target but also to avoid detection—both of which are beyond the capabilities of limited, scripted programs, says Volkov. “They can look at a target and guess the best ways to penetrate it,” he says. “That kind of thing is out of reach of, like, dumb scripted bots.”\n\nSince LLM Agent Honeypot went live in October of last year, it has logged more than 11 million attempts to access it—the vast majority of which were from curious humans and bots. But among these, the researchers have detected eight potential AI agents, two of which they have confirmed are agents that appear to originate from Hong Kong and Singapore, respectively. \n\n“We would guess that these confirmed agents were experiments directly launched by humans with the agenda of something like ‘Go out into the internet and try and hack something interesting for me,’” says Volkov. The team plans to expand its honeypot into social media platforms, websites, and databases to attract and capture a broader range of attackers, including spam bots and phishing agents, to analyze future threats. \n\nTo determine which visitors to the vulnerable servers were LLM-powered agents, the researchers embedded prompt-injection techniques into the honeypot. These attacks are designed to change the behavior of AI agents by issuing them new instructions and asking questions that require humanlike intelligence. This approach wouldn’t work on standard bots.\n\nFor example, one of the injected prompts asked the visitor to return the command “cat8193” to gain access. If the visitor correctly complied with the instruction, the researchers checked how long it took to do so, assuming that LLMs are able to respond in much less time than it takes a human to read the request and type out an answer—typically in under 1.5 seconds. While the two confirmed AI agents passed both tests, the six others only entered the command but didn’t meet the response time that would identify them as AI agents.\n\nExperts are still unsure when agent-orchestrated attacks will become more widespread. Stockley, whose company Malwarebytes named agentic AI as a notable new cybersecurity threat in its 2025 State of Malware report, thinks we could be living in a world of agentic attackers as soon as this year. \n\nAnd although regular agentic AI is still at a very early stage—and criminal or malicious use of agentic AI even more so—it’s even more of a Wild West than the LLM field was two years ago, says Vincenzo Ciancaglini, a senior threat researcher at the security company Trend Micro. \n\n“Palisade Research’s approach is brilliant: basically hacking the AI agents that try to hack you first,” he says. “While in this case we’re witnessing AI agents trying to do reconnaissance, we’re not sure when agents will be able to carry out a full attack chain autonomously. That’s what we’re trying to keep an eye on.” \n\nAnd while it’s possible that malicious agents will be used for intelligence gathering before graduating to simple attacks and eventually complex attacks as the agentic systems themselves become more complex and reliable, it’s equally possible there will be an unexpected overnight explosion in criminal usage, he says: “That’s the weird thing about AI development right now.”\n\nThose trying to defend against agentic cyberattacks should keep in mind that AI is currently more of an accelerant to existing attack techniques than something that fundamentally changes the nature of attacks, says Chris Betz, chief information security officer at Amazon Web Services. “Certain attacks may be simpler to conduct and therefore more numerous; however, the foundation of how to detect and respond to these events remains the same,” he says.\n\nAgents could also be deployed to detect vulnerabilities and protect against intruders, says Edoardo Debenedetti, a PhD student at ETH Zürich in Switzerland, pointing out that if a friendly agent cannot find any vulnerabilities in a system, it’s unlikely that a similarly capable agent used by a malicious party is going to be able to find any either.\n\nWhile we know that AI’s potential to autonomously conduct cyberattacks is a growing risk and that AI agents are already scanning the internet, one useful next step is to evaluate how good agents are at finding and exploiting these real-world vulnerabilities. Daniel Kang, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and his team have built a benchmark to evaluate this; they have found that current AI agents successfully exploited up to 13% of vulnerabilities for which they had no prior knowledge. Providing the agents with a brief description of the vulnerability pushed the success rate up to 25%, demonstrating how AI systems are able to identify and exploit weaknesses even without training. Basic bots would presumably do much worse.\n\nThe benchmark provides a standardized way to assess these risks, and Kang hopes it can guide the development of safer AI systems. “I’m hoping that people start to be more proactive about the potential risks of AI and cybersecurity before it has a ChatGPT moment,” he says. “I’m afraid people won’t realize this until it punches them in the face.”",

    "title": "Trump’s tariffs will deliver a big blow to climate tech",
    "content": "US president Donald Trump’s massive, sweeping tariffs sent global stock markets tumbling on Thursday, setting the stage for a worldwide trade war and ratcheting up the dangers of a punishing recession. \n\nExperts fear that the US cleantech sector is especially vulnerable to a deep downturn, which would undermine the nation’s progress on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and undercut its leadership in an essential, growing industry.\n\n“It would be hard for me to think of cleantech or climate tech sectors that aren’t facing huge risks,” says Noah Kaufman, senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, who served on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Joe Biden. \n\n“I think we’re a country without a federal climate strategy at this point, with an economy headed in the wrong direction, so I don’t see a lot of reason to be optimistic,” he adds.\n\nHow deep and wide-ranging the impact of the coming economic shifts could be depends on many variables still in play and on reactions still to come. In particular, the negotiations underway in Congress over the budget will determine the fate of subsidies for electric vehicles, battery production, and other clean technologies. Many of those programs were established by former president Biden’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBut there are mounting challenges and rising risks across the cleantech and climate tech sectors. Notably any slowdown in the broader economy threatens to tighten corporate and venture capital funding for startups working on carbon removal, synthetic aviation fuels, electric delivery vehicles, and other technologies that help companies meet climate action goals. \n\nIn addition, Trump’s tariffs, particularly the now 54% levy on Chinese goods, will push up the costs of key components for many businesses. Notably, the US imported $4 billion worth of lithium-ion batteries from China during the first four months of last year, so the tariff increase would impose a huge tax on products that go into electric vehicles, laptops, phones, and many other devices. \n\nHigher prices for aluminum, steel, copper, cement, and numerous other goods and materials will also drive up the costs of doing all sorts of business, including building wind turbines, solar farms, and geothermal plants. And if China, Canada, the European Union, and other nations respond with retaliatory trade measures, as is widely expected, it will also become harder or more expensive for US companies to export goods like EVs or battery components to overseas markets. \n\nEven traditional energy stocks took a beating on Wall Street Thursday, out of fear that any broader economic sluggishness will drive down electricity demand.\n\nTrump administration cuts to the Department of Energy and other federal programs could also take away money from demonstration projects that help cleantech companies test and scale up their technologies. And if Congress does eliminate certain subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act, it could halt billion-dollar projects that are being planned or perhaps even some that are already under construction.\n\nThe growing policy uncertainty and weakening economic conditions alone may already be causing some of this to occur.\n\nSince Trump took office, companies have canceled, delayed, or scaled back at least nine US “clean energy supply chain” developments or operations, according to the Big Green Machine, a database maintained by Jay Turner, a professor of environmental studies at Wellesley College, and student researchers there. The projects that have been affected represent some $8 billion in public and private investments, and more than 9,000 jobs.\n\nThey include KORE Power’s planned battery facility in Arizona, which the company halted; Envision Automotive Energy Supply’s paused expansion in Florence County, South Carolina; and Akasol’s closure of two plants in Michigan. \n\nVW also scaled back production at its recently expanded EV factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, amid slower-than-expected growth in sales and, perhaps, the expectation that the Trump administration will strive to roll back consumer tax credits for vehicle purchases.\n\n“The biggest challenge for companies that are making hundred-million- or billion-dollar capital investments is dealing with the uncertainty,” Turner says. “Uncertainty is a real deterrent to making big bets.” \n\nVenture capital investments in clean energy have been cooling for a while. They peaked at $24.5 billion in 2022 and settled at around $18 billion annually during the last two years, according to data provided by Pitchbook. First-quarter figures for this year aren’t yet available, though industry watchers are keen to see where they land. \n\nSome parts of the cleantech sector could hold up better than others through the Trump administration and any upcoming economic gloom. \n\nThe Pitchbook report, for instance, noted that the surge in development of AI data centers is fueling demand for “dispatchable energy sources.” That means the type that can run around the clock, such as nuclear fission, fusion, and geothermal (though in practice, the data center boom has often meant commissioning or relying on natural-gas plants that produce planet-warming emissions).\n\nTrump’s new energy secretary, Chris Wright, previously the chief executive of the oilfield services company Liberty Energy, has also talked favorably about nuclear power and geothermal—and rather unfavorably about renewables like solar and wind. \n\nBut observers fear that more sectors will lose than win in any economic downturn to come, and Turner stresses that the decisions made during this administration could last well beyond it.\n\n“The near-term concern is that this emerging clean-energy industry in the US suffers a significant pullback and the US cedes this market to other countries, especially China, that are actively working to position themselves to be leaders in the clean-energy future,” he says. \n\nThe long-term concern, he adds, is that if government policies on cleantech simply advance and retreat with the whims of each administration, companies will stop trying to make long-term investments that bank on such subsidies, grants or loans. \n\nCatherine Wolfram, a professor of energy and applied economics at MIT, also notes that China and the European Union are forging ahead in developing policies to drive down emissions and build up carbon-free sectors. She observes that they’re both now moving on to the tougher work of cleaning up heavy industries like steel, while the US is “losing ground on even making clean electricity.”\n\n“It’s the worst kind of US exceptionalism,” she says.",

    "title": "Q1 Global Startup Funding Posts Strongest Quarter Since Q2 2022 With A Third Going To Massive OpenAI Deal  ",
    "content": "Both the largest startup funding round ever and the largest acquisition of a venture-backed company occurred in Q1 2025, reflecting a warming startup environment but also one where capital and opportunities were concentrated among a handful of companies and sectors.\n\nOverall, the quarter marked the strongest one for venture investment since Q2 2022.\n\nBut the quarterly numbers were significantly buoyed by a single round: OpenAI raised the largest private round ever, a $40 billion funding that values the company at $300 billion.\n\nThe deal — which alone accounts for more than half of U.S. venture funding and a third of global funding last quarter — pushed global startup investment in Q1 to $113 billion, Crunchbase data shows. Funding to just the AI sector comprised more than half of last quarter’s global total.\n\nTotal startup funding in Q1 was up 17% quarter over quarter from $96 billion in Q4 2024 and up 54% year over year from $73 billion in Q1 2024.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBillions more in funding\nU.S. gained\nStrongest M&A quarter since 2021\nAI capital concentrated\nLate stage was up\nEarly stage trails\nSeed falls\nCapEx and concentration\nMethodology\nGlossary of funding terms\n\nBillions more in funding\n\nOpenAI moved from the third-most valuable private company to the second-most valuable after SpaceX, which is currently valued at $350 billion. OpenAI has raised a total of $57.6 billion since its founding in 2015. The latest round represents more than two-thirds of the San Francisco-based company’s total funding since it was founded, adding to the $6.6 billion it raised in Q4.\n\nCompetitor Anthropic also raised billions in funding in Q1, but even so, it was a fraction of what OpenAI raised. Anthropic raised $4.5 billion across two funding rounds, after raising $4 billion in Q4.\n\nGenerative AI companies were not the only companies to raise billion-dollar rounds in Q1. U.S.-based immersive reality company Infinite Reality raised $3 billion, and crypto asset company Binance raised $2 billion.\n\nBy comparison, the peak quarter of 2024 was Q4 with $96 billion in total funding. That quarter included a spate of billion-dollar rounds to U.S.-based data and AI companies. Databricks, OpenAI, xAI and Anthropic collectively raised $26.6 billion — a quarter of global funding.\nU.S. gained\n\nVenture funding to U.S. companies totaled $80 billion in Q1 2025, accounting for around 71% of global funding. Funding to Bay Area-based companies alone reached $55 billion, accounting for 69% of U.S. venture capital funding and 49% of global funding.\nStrongest M&A quarter since 2021\n\nQ1 2025 was also the strongest quarter for startup M&A dollar volume since 2021, totaling $71 billion in reported exit value.\n\nWiz’s acquisition by Google, if finalized, will mark the largest acquisition for a private company with a price tag of $32 billion. The deal is still subject to regulatory approval.\n\nIn total, there were 12 acquisitions above $1 billion for venture-backed startups. The most notable include Ampere’s acquisition by SoftBank, Modernizing Medicine’s purchase by Clearlake Capital Group, Moveworks’ acquisition by ServiceNow, and Weights & Biases’ purchase by CoreWeave.\n\nWhile the dollar volume for global M&A was high, deal counts for the quarter came in at more than 500, but remained well below market peak quarters of the around 800 global M&A deals seen in 2021, Crunchbase data shows.\n\nGlobal M&A for venture-backed companies averaged $63 billion each quarter in 2021, with a peak quarter that year at $71 billion, Crunchbase data shows.\nAI capital concentrated\n\nAI was the leading sector for venture funding in the first quarter, with $59.6 billion invested. Last quarter marked the strongest quarter for AI funding ever, with an astonishing 53% of global funding going to the AI sector alone.\n\nThis followed a strong fourth quarter when $44 billion was raised by AI startups globally.\n\nHealthcare and biotech was the second-largest sector for funding in Q1, with $18 billion invested. Financial services companies, the third-largest sector in the quarter, totaled $10.8 billion.\n\nLate stage was up\n\nLate-stage funding in the first quarter gained quarter over quarter. Funding reached $81 billion, up more than 30% quarter over quarter and an increase of 147% year over year from the $33 billion invested in Q1 2024, Crunchbase data shows.\n\nEarly stage trails\n\nEarly-stage funding was slightly down in Q1 reaching $24 billion. Larger Series A and B rounds were led by the healthcare and biotech sector. Large rounds were also found in robotics, AI and cloud services, among other sectors.\n\nSeed falls\n\nSeed funding reached $7.2 billion in Q1, down 14% from $8.4 billion invested a year ago. (Seed funding totals typically increase over time, as many seed rounds are added to the Crunchbase dataset after the close of a quarter.)\n\nCapEx and concentration\n\nThe venture markets are adapting to the massive opportunities that AI unleashes and the imposing costs of its computation. Last quarter tells that story, with more than a third of capital invested in a single company, OpenAI.\n\nValuations are increasing at a faster pace. The Crunchbase Unicorn Board has added around $400 billion in value in the first quarter — from  the 29 companies that joined and from existing unicorns that raised rounds at higher values. The board reached $1 trillion in total funding in January this year and currently tops $5.8 trillion in value.\n\nThe IPO markets for tech companies were slow in Q1. The most high-profile company to go public was New Jersey-based CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure cloud service provider. Its shares priced below their range at $40 per share, but have since seen a significant uptick in price.\n\nWith future large outcomes, M&A has heated up, providing some much-needed liquidity to the venture capital industry.\nMethodology\n\nThe data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of April 2, 2025.\n\nNote that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.\n\nPlease note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.\nGlossary of funding terms\n\nSeed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.\n\nEarly-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.\n\nLate-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round.\n\nTechnology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

    "title": "Tariff-Induced Market Meltdown Worrisome For Startup Valuations And Exits",
    "content": "Unlike public companies, private startup valuations don’t fluctuate massively from day to day based on current events.\n\nEventually, however, private company prices do adjust to reflect trends in the broader markets.\n\nAnd based on what we’re seeing today, things look worrisome.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index was down a staggering 4.8% in midday trading today, following President Trump’s decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imported goods. His order calls for a 10% baseline tariff, along with much higher rates for many countries.\n\nAmong its myriad impacts, the decision is expected to lead to higher consumer prices and depressed demand as manufacturers and retailers pass along tariff costs incurred by their businesses. That was reflected in some of today’s more pronounced drops 1 for tech and consumer bellwethers, including Amazon (down 7%), Apple (down 8%),  Nike (down 10%), and Wayfair (down 25%).\nStartup correction delayed?\n\nNow, over in startupland, we’re not seeing immediate revaluations. For hot startups, repricings might happen once every few months or quarters when there’s a new funding round. And ordinarily, it’s common for companies to go a couple years between revaluations.\n\nThat means the $300 billion post-money valuation announced for OpenAI this week, and the $113 billion valuation set for the newly combined X and xAI aren’t seeing an instant price cut like leading AI chip supplier Nvidia (down 5%).\n\nBut looking ahead, the trajectory appears concerning.\n\nFor one, it’s only a couple years since the last massive startup valuation correction. Scores of companies that enjoyed unicorn status around the market peak in late 2021 later settled for down rounds, folded or filed for bankruptcy.\n\nIn addition, the tech IPO market was sluggish in 2023 and 2024, and only just recently shows signs of warming up. We had a mega-offering last week from CoreWeave, which had a recent market cap around $24 billion. Large offerings from Klarna and Circle are also expected to hit markets in coming weeks.\n\nIn a similar vein, M&A was also on the rise, led by Google’s planned $32 billion purchase of cybersecurity unicorn Wiz, and a bump in billion-dollar-plus acquisitions.\n\nSo, for startup exits, we were finally getting out of a slump, only to face a new obstacle in the form of a tariff-driven market pullback.\nDumb + unpopular = a case for optimism\n\nLooking for a case for optimism in the current scenario, I find myself turning to reality TV. The principle of this media niche has long been that one can succeed with something dumb, so long as it’s popular. However, if a show is both pointlessly stupid and not fun to watch, it will flop.\n\nThe same notion applies to a lot of other areas, including movies, music, romance novels, podcasts, and the list goes on. So why not new tariffs?\n\nAs public markets have demonstrated today, investors find the current tariff moves both dumb and unpopular. Hopefully, those with power to revise foolish decisions will take this as a reason to reverse course. I’m not giving it the highest likelihood, but it’s at least within the realm of possibility.\nRelated reading:\n\nWith Google’s $32B Bid For Wiz, Big Exits Are Finally Picking Up\nA Booming Start To The Year For The Billion-Dollar Exits Board\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman\n\nBased on prices at around noon ET.&#8617;",

    "title": "What Is DevSecOps And Why Does It Matter In The Age Of AI?",
    "content": "By Sanket Saurav\n\nInterest in DevSecOps has surged in recent years — but many people probably don’t know what it is, or why it has become especially important for tech companies in the age of AI.\n\nWhen building software, someone has to make sure it doesn’t contain bugs that can later be exploited by bad actors. Today’s AI code generation tools can produce vast amounts of code quickly, but often with many hidden vulnerabilities. Adopting DevSecOps helps tech companies mitigate these risks, but it’s a relatively new approach.\n\nTwenty years ago, most companies deployed their code using three teams: development (writing code), operations (deployment) and security, which usually reviewed the code for vulnerabilities just before shipping. Security was often a reactive step occurring late in the process.\n\nDevelopment and operations eventually merged into DevOps, and in recent years, it became clear that security should be as close to the development process as possible, not an afterthought. DevSecOps was born. A number of changes have made it especially important for tech teams to adopt a robust DevSecOps strategy.\nAI-generated code has intensified security needs\nSanket Saurav of DeepSource\n\nWith today’s generative AI tools, five developers can generate the work of 20 people. However, automation for code security has not kept pace, creating huge gaps in security compliance. Human reviewers simply can’t deal with the surge in volume.\n\nStudies on AI-generated code found that almost half the code had bugs that could lead to harmful exploitation. Every company today needs to be using automated code security tools — namely static application security testing, or SAST, software — so the code they’re rapidly shipping out doesn’t shoot them in the foot tomorrow.\nDevelopers are relying more on open source\n\nSoftware developers have been integrating much more open-source code into their projects in recent years, meaning they depend on code that’s been developed externally and repeatedly modified by individual contributors. Each open-source “package” uses an entire chain of third-party code: The average open-source JavaScript package relies on 377 third-party packages, and up to 90% of applications’ code is estimated to be open-sourced.\n\nDevelopers have far less control over the quality and security of these “dependencies.” Real-life examples of this happening include Log4j, a widely used open-source program that had a serious security flaw allowing hackers to take control of devices that used it.\n\nDevSecOps tools such as Software Composition Analysis, or SCA, analyze those open-source components of a codebase for any security vulnerabilities. Because they can do so rapidly and at scale, they can better insulate security-conscious teams.\nSoftware releases have become more frequent\n\nWhile a few years ago, traditional development cycles allowed time for manual security reviews  (releases happened every few weeks), software releases now get deployed every few hours. Faster deployments risk creating a “security debt” that compounds with each release.\n\nIt’s particularly important for automated tools to step in to secure that continuous deployment, or the security debt could lead to vulnerability proliferation, as each undetected flaw becomes the foundation for dozens of dependent features.\nEven smaller startups are being asked to meet security standards\n\nWhile larger companies typically have DevSecOps capabilities, smaller startups have often focused on product development over security. But nowadays, enterprises purchasing B2B SaaS are compelling those providers to obtain SOC2 Type 2 compliance, which demands a holistic security program.\n\nThat can’t be done without a robust code security strategy and tooling in place.\n\nCode security has always been an important part of software development, but recent trends have shifted security closer to the active software development process, and therefore increased the need for fast and efficient security tools.\n\nSanket Saurav is the co-founder and CEO of DeepSource, a company with a mission to help developers write secure code with static analysis and AI.\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

    "title": "Eye On AI: Massive OpenAI Deal Masks AI’s Slow Quarter",
    "content": "This column is a look back at the week that was in AI. Read the previous one here.\n\nThe big news in the world of venture and artificial intelligence obviously has been OpenAI&#8216;s massive $40 billion investment led by SoftBank.\n\nThat big-money deal has folks talking, but a deeper look at the funding numbers for AI in Q1 seem to show a slight pullback from investors, in both the private and public markets, as more questions arise concerning how much large enterprises will continue (or start in some cases) throwing at AI tools.\nPrivate market\n\nAs our first-quarter 2025 global venture funding report illustrates, AI funding was again at an all-time high — just as it was in Q4 2024.\n\nAfter hitting nearly $44 billion in Q4, total venture funding to AI startups was almost $60 billion in the first quarter of this year. While that seems impressive — and it is, to a certain extent — it’s hard to ignore the fact that two-thirds of that amount is directly related to one company and its massive raise led by SoftBank.\n\nIf we put that to the side, AI startups in Q1 raised less than half of what was doled out in Q4 last year, getting about $19.6 billion, per Crunchbase data. The biggest deal — aside from OpenAI’s — of the quarter saw Anthropic, a ChatGPT rival with its AI assistant Claude, raise a $3.5 billion funding round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners that valued it at $61.5 billion.\n\nThere were many massive deals for AI startups in Q4, including Databricks’ $10 billion round, OpenAI’s long-awaited raise of $6.6 billion, and xAI’s $6 billion in a funding round. In fact, there were 11 rounds of $500 million or more, while Q1 saw just five.\n\nIf one takes that $19.6 billion total, it would be the lowest for a quarter since AI startups raised only $13.9 billion in Q1 2024.\n\nDeal flow for AI startups also dipped in Q1 of this year, with only 1,226 deals announced — marking a roughly 25% drop from Q1 last year and more than 150 rounds fewer than Q4.\nPublic market\n\nBut it’s not just about the private market and venture capital. The poster-child for AI on the public market, Nvidia, had a bad quarter in the stock market in Q1, with shares dropping more than 20%, while semiconductor company AMD’s shares shaved off nearly 15%.\n\nShares of Oracle, a big player in the U.S.’ new AI endeavor, The Stargate Project, dropped more than 15% for the quarter. The Nasdaq Composite Index — a good general indicator of how tech stocks are faring — was down about 10% for the quarter.\n\nOf course, the big news on the public market was CoreWeave’s IPO, but the big event barely made any waves as the stock remained relatively flat after premiering (even after the offering significantly shrank in size).\nCautious investing\n\nCoreWeave’s IPO  — which had been looked at as a bellwether for the expected thawing of the IPO market — may be the best illustration of investors starting to take a hard look at what’s going on in a heated market.\n\nAs the IPO approached, there seemed to be more questions and concerns being voiced about how quickly AI adoption will happen for many large companies and how much they are willing to allocate to data center spend. There is also worry that with so many data centers being built, supply could outstrip demand and lower prices.\n\nOf course, Q2 may be an entirely different story in both the private and public markets, and the OpenAI round did, in fact, happen, so that investment can’t just be discounted.\n\nHowever, there is also a chance investors are starting to look more closely at AI and where the market for spend on the technology is actually going.\n\nThat would be something different.\nRelated Crunchbase Pro query:\n\nRounds Raised By Startups Using AI\n\nRelated reading:\n\nCoreWeave Shrinks IPO\nEye On AI: AI Venture Funding Shattered Quarterly Records In Q4\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

    "title": "We should talk more about air-conditioning",
    "content": "Things are starting to warm up here in the New York City area, and it’s got me thinking once again about something that people aren’t talking about enough: energy demand for air conditioners. \n\nI get it: Data centers are the shiny new thing to worry about. And I’m not saying we shouldn’t be thinking about the strain that gigawatt-scale computing installations put on the grid. But a little bit of perspective is important here.\n\nAccording to a report from the International Energy Agency last year, data centers will make up less than 10% of the increase in energy demand between now and 2030, far less than the energy demand from space cooling (mostly air-conditioning).\n\nI just finished up a new story that’s out today about a novel way to make heat exchangers, a crucial component in air conditioners and a whole host of other technologies that cool our buildings, food, and electronics. Let’s dig into why I’m writing about the guts of cooling technologies, and why this sector really needs innovation. \n\nOne twisted thing about cooling and climate change: It’s all a vicious cycle. As temperatures rise, the need for cooling technologies increases. In turn, more fossil-fuel power plants are firing up to meet that demand, turning up the temperature of the planet in the process.\n\n“Cooling degree days” are one measure of the need for additional cooling. Basically, you take a preset baseline temperature and figure out how much the temperature exceeds it. Say the baseline (above which you’d likely need to flip on a cooling device) is 21 °C (70 °F). If the average temperature for a day is 26 °C, that’s five cooling degree days on a single day. Repeat that every day for a month, and you wind up with 150 cooling degree days.\n\nI explain this arguably weird metric because it’s a good measure of total energy demand for cooling—it lumps together both how many hot days there are and just how hot it is. \n\nAnd the number of cooling degree days is steadily ticking up globally. Global cooling degree days were 6% higher in 2024 than in 2023, and 20% higher than the long-term average for the first two decades of the century. Regions that have high cooling demand, like China, India, and the US, were particularly affected, according to the IEA report. You can see a month-by-month breakdown of this data from the IEA here.\n\nThat increase in cooling degree days is leading to more demand for air conditioners, and for energy to power them. Air-conditioning accounted for 7% of the world’s electricity demand in 2022, and it’s only going to get more important from here.\n\nThere were fewer than 2 billion AC units in the world in 2016. By 2050, that could be nearly 6 billion, according to a 2018 report from the IEA. This is a measure of progress and, in a way, something we should be happy about; the number of air conditioners tends to rise with household income. But it does present a challenge to the grid.  \n\nAnother piece of this whole thing: It’s not just about how much total electricity we need to run air conditioners but about when that demand tends to come. As we’ve covered in this newsletter before, your air-conditioning habits aren’t unique. Cooling devices tend to flip on around the same time—when it’s hot. In some parts of the US, for example, air conditioners can represent more than 70% of residential energy demand at times when the grid is most stressed.\n\nThe good news is that we’re seeing innovations in cooling technology. Some companies are building cooling systems that include an energy storage component, so they can charge up when energy is plentiful and demand is low. Then they can start cooling when it’s most needed, without sucking as much energy from the grid during peak hours.\n\nWe’ve also covered alternatives to air conditioners called desiccant cooling systems, which use special moisture-sucking materials to help cool spaces and deal with humidity more efficiently than standard options.\n\nAnd in my latest story, I dug into new developments in heat exchanger technology. Heat exchangers are a crucial component of air conditioners, but you can really find them everywhere—in heat pumps, refrigerators, and, yes, the cooling systems in large buildings and large electronics installations, including data centers.\n\nWe’ve been building heat exchangers basically the same way for nearly a century. These components basically move heat around, and there are a few known ways to do so with devices that are relatively straightforward to manufacture. Now, though, one team of researchers has 3D-printed a heat exchanger that outperforms some standard designs and rivals others. This is still a long way from solving our looming air-conditioning crisis, but the details are fascinating—I hope you’ll give it a read. \n\nWe need more innovation in cooling technology to help meet global demand efficiently so we don’t stay stuck in this cycle. And we’ll need policy and public support to make sure that these technologies make a difference and that everyone has access to them too. \n\nThis article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review’s weekly climate newsletter.

    "title": "Rivals are rising to challenge the dominance of SpaceX",
    "content": "SpaceX is a space launch juggernaut. In just two decades, the company has managed to edge out former aerospace heavyweights Boeing, Lockheed, and Northrop Grumman to gain near-monopoly status over rocket launches in the US; it accounted for 87% of the country’s orbital launches in 2024, according to an analysis by SpaceNews. Since the mid-2010s, the company has dominated NASA’s launch contracts and become a major Pentagon contractor. It is now also the go-to launch provider for commercial customers, having lofted numerous satellites and five private crewed spaceflights, with more to come. \n\nOther space companies have been scrambling to compete for years, but developing a reliable rocket takes slow, steady work and big budgets. Now at least some of them are catching up. \n\nA host of companies have readied rockets that are comparable to SpaceX’s main launch vehicles. The list includes Rocket Lab, which aims to take on SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9 with its Neutron rocket and could have its first launch in late 2025, and Blue Origin, owned by Jeff Bezos, which recently completed the first mission of a rocket it hopes will compete against SpaceX’s Starship. \n\nSome of these competitors are just starting to get rockets off the ground. And the companies could also face unusual headwinds, given that SpaceX’s Elon Musk has an especially close relationship with the Trump administration and has allies at federal regulatory agencies, including those that provide oversight of the industry.\n\nBut if all goes well, the SpaceX challengers can help improve access to space and prevent bottlenecks if one company experiences a setback. “More players in the market is good for competition,” says Chris Combs, an aerospace engineer at the University of Texas at San Antonio. “I think for the foreseeable future it will still be hard to compete with SpaceX on price.” But, he says, the competitors could push SpaceX itself to become better and provide those seeking access to space with a wider array of options..\n\nA big lift\n\nThere are a few reasons why SpaceX was able to cement its position in the space industry. When it began in the 2000s, it had three consecutive rocket failures and seemed poised to fold. But it barreled through with Musk’s financial support, and later with a series of NASA and defense contracts. It has been a primary beneficiary of NASA’s commercial space program, developed in the 2010s with the intention of propping up the industry. \n\n“They got government contracts from the very beginning,” says Victoria Samson, a space policy expert at the Secure World Foundation in Broomfield, Colorado. “I wouldn’t say it’s a handout, but SpaceX would not exist without a huge influx of repeated government contracts. To this day, they’re still dependent on government customers, though they have commercial customers too.”\n\nSpaceX has also effectively achieved a high degree of vertical integration, Samson points out: It owns almost all parts of its supply chain, designing, building, and testing all its major hardware components in-house, with a minimal use of suppliers. That gives it not just control over its hardware but considerably lower costs, and the price tag is the top consideration for launch contracts. \n\nThe company was also open to taking risks other industry stalwarts were not. “I think for a very long time the industry looked at spaceflight as something that had to be very precise and perfect, and not a lot of room for tinkering,” says Combs. “SpaceX really was willing to take some risks and accept failure in ways that others haven’t been. That’s easier to do when you’re backed by a billionaire.” \n\nWhat’s finally enabled international and US-based competitors to emerge has been a growing customer base looking for launch services, along with some investors’ deep pockets. \n\nSome of these companies are taking aim at SpaceX’s Falcon 9, which can lift as much as about 20,000 kilograms into orbit and is used for sending multiple satellites or the crewed Dragon into space. “There is a practical monopoly in the medium-lift launch market right now, with really only one operational vehicle,” says Murielle Baker, a spokesperson for Rocket Lab, a US-New Zealand company.\n\nRocket Lab plans to take on the Falcon 9 with its Neutron rocket, which is expected to have its inaugural flight later this year from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. The effort is building on the success of the company’s smaller Electron rocket, and Neutron’s first stage is intended to be reusable after it parachutes down to the ocean. \n\nAnother challenger is Texas-based Firefly, whose Alpha rocket can be launched from multiple spaceports so that it can reach different orbits. Firefly has already secured NASA and Space Force contracts, with more launches coming this year (and on March 2 it also became the second private company to successfully land a spacecraft on the moon). Next year, Relativity Space aims to loft its first Terran R rocket, which is partially built from 3D-printed components. And the Bill Gates–backed Stoke Space aims to launch its reusable Nova rocket in late 2025 or, more likely, next year.\n\nCompetitors are also rising for SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, holding out the prospect of more options for sending massive payloads to higher orbits and deep space. Furthest along is the Vulcan Centaur rocket, a creation of United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. It’s expected to have its third and fourth launches in the coming months, delivering Space Force satellites to orbit. Powered by engines from Blue Origin, the Vulcan Centaur is slightly wider and shorter than the Falcon rockets. It currently isn’t reusable, but it’s less expensive than its predecessors, ULA’s Atlas V and Delta IV, which are being phased out. \n\nMark Peller, the company’s senior vice president on Vulcan development and advanced programs, says the new rocket comes with multiple advantages. “One is overall value, in terms of dollars per pound to orbit and what we can provide to our customers,” he says, “and the second is versatility: Vulcan was designed to go to a range of orbits.” He says more than 80 missions are already lined up. \n\nVulcan’s fifth flight, slated for no earlier than May, will launch the long-awaited Sierra Space Dream Chaser, a spaceplane that can carry cargo (and possibly crew) to the International Space Station. ULA also has upcoming Vulcan launches planned for Amazon’s Kuiper satellite constellation, a potential Starlink rival.\n\nMeanwhile, though it took a few years, Blue Origin now has a truly orbital heavy-lift spacecraft: In January, it celebrated the inaugural launch of its towering New Glenn, a rocket that’s only a bit shorter than NASA’s Space Launch System and SpaceX’s Starship. Future flights could launch national security payloads. \n\nCompetition is emerging abroad as well. After repeated delays, Europe’s heavy-lift Ariane 6, from Airbus subsidiary Arianespace, had its inaugural flight last year, ending the European Space Agency’s temporary dependence on SpaceX. A range of other companies are trying to expand European launch capacity, with assistance from ESA.\n\nChina is moving quickly on its own launch organizations too. “They had no less than seven ‘commercial’ space launch companies that were all racing to develop an effective system that could deliver a payload into orbit,” Kari Bingen, director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says of China’s efforts. “They are moving fast and they have capital behind them, and they will absolutely be a competitor on the global market once they’re successful and probably undercut what US and European launch companies are doing.” The up-and-coming Chinese launchers include Space Pioneer’s reusable Tianlong-3 rocket and Cosmoleap’s Yueqian rocket. The latter is to feature a “chopstick clamp” recovery of the first stage, where it’s grabbed by the launch tower’s mechanical arms, similar to the concept SpaceX is testing for its Starship.\n\nGlitches and government\n\nBefore SpaceX’s rivals can really compete, they need to work out the kinks, demonstrate the reliability of their new spacecraft, and show that they can deliver low-cost launch services to customers. \n\nThe process is not without its challenges. Boeing’s Starliner delivered astronauts to the ISS on its first crewed flight in June 2024, but after thruster malfunctions, they were left stranded at the orbital outpost for nine months. While New Glenn reached orbit as planned, its first stage didn’t land successfully and its upper stage was left in orbit. \n\nSpaceX itself has had some recent struggles. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded the Falcon 9 more than once following malfunctions in the second half of 2024. The company still shattered records last year, though, with more than 130 Falcon 9 launches. It has continued with that record pace this year, despite additional Falcon 9 delays and more glitches with its booster and upper stage. SpaceX also conducted its eighth Starship test flight in March, just two months after the previous one, but both failed minutes after liftoff, raining debris down from the sky.\n\nAny company must deal with financial challenges as well as engineering ones. Boeing is reportedly considering selling parts of its space business, following Starliner’s malfunctions and problems with its 737 Max aircraft. And Virgin Orbit, the launch company that spun off from Virgin Galactic, shuttered in 2023.\n\nAnother issue facing would-be commercial competitors to SpaceX in the US is the complex and uncertain political environment. Musk does not manage day-to-day operations of the company. But he has close involvement with DOGE, a Trump administration initiative that has been exerting influence on the workforces and budgets of NASA, the Defense Department, and regulators relevant to the space industry. \n\nJared Isaacman, a billionaire who bankrolled the groundbreaking 2021 commercial mission Inspiration4, returned to orbit, again via a SpaceX craft, on Polaris Dawn last September. Now he may become Trump’s NASA chief, a position that could give him the power to nudge NASA toward awarding new lucrative contracts to SpaceX. In February it was reported that SpaceX’s Starlink might land a multibillion-dollar FAA contract previously awarded to Verizon. \n\nIt is also possible that SpaceX could strengthen its position with respect to the regulatory scrutiny it has faced for environmental and safety issues at its production and launch sites on the coasts of Texas and Florida, as well as scrutiny of its rocket crashes and the resulting space debris. Oversight from the FAA, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Environmental Protection Agency may be weak. Conflicts of interest have already emerged at the FAA, and the Trump administration has also attempted to incapacitate the National Labor Relations Board. SpaceX had previously tried to block the board from acting after nine workers accused the company of unfair labor practices.\n\nSpaceX did not respond to MIT Technology Review’s requests for comment for this story.\n\n“I think there’s going to be a lot of emphasis to relieve a lot of the regulations, in terms of environmental impact studies, and things like that,” Samson says. “I thought there’d be a separation between [Musk’s] interests, but now, it’s hard to say where he stops and the US government begins.”\n\nRegardless of the politics, the commercial competition will surely heat up throughout 2025. But SpaceX has a considerable head start, Bingen argues: “It’s going to take a lot for these companies to effectively compete and potentially dislodge SpaceX, given the dominant position that [it has] had.”\n\nRamin Skibba is an astrophysicist turned science writer and freelance journalist, based in the Bay Are",

    "title": "The machines are rising — but developers still hold the keys",
    "content": "Rumors of the ongoing death of software development — that it’s being slain by AI — are greatly exaggerated. In reality, software development is at a fork in the road: embracing the (currently) far-off notion of fully automated software development or acknowledging the work of a software developer is much more than just writing lines of code.\n\nThe decision the industry makes could have significant long-term consequences. Increasing complacency around AI-generated code and a shift to what has been termed “vibe coding” — where code is generated through natural language prompts until the results seem to work — will lead to code that’s more error-strewn, more expensive to run and harder to change in the future. And, if the devaluation of software development skills continues, we may even lack a workforce with the skills and knowledge to fix things down the line. \n\nThis means software developers are going to become more important to how the world builds and maintains software. Yes, there are many ways their practices will evolve thanks to AI coding assistance, but in a world of proliferating machine-generated code, developer judgment and experience will be vital.\n\nThe dangers of AI-generated code are already here\n\nThe risks of AI-generated code aren’t science fiction: they’re with us today. Research done by GitClear earlier this year indicates that with AI coding assistants (like GitHub Copilot) going mainstream, code churn — which GitClear defines as “changes that were either incomplete or erroneous when the author initially wrote, committed, and pushed them to the company’s git repo&#8221; — has significantly increased. GitClear also found there was a marked decrease in the number of lines of code that have been moved, a signal for refactored code (essentially the care and feeding to make it more effective).\n\nIn other words, from the time coding assistants were introduced there’s been a pronounced increase in lines of code without a commensurate increase in lines deleted, updated, or replaced. Simultaneously, there&#8217;s been a decrease in lines moved — indicating a lot of code has been written but not refactored. More code isn’t necessarily a good thing (sometimes quite the opposite); GitClear’s findings ultimately point to complacency and a lack of rigor about code quality.\n\nCan AI be removed from software development?\n\nHowever, AI doesn’t have to be removed from software development and delivery. On the contrary, there’s plenty to be excited about. As noted in the latest volume of the Technology Radar — Thoughtworks’ report on technologies and practices from work with hundreds of clients all over the world — the coding assistance space is full of opportunities. \n\nSpecifically, the report noted tools like Cursor, Cline and Windsurf can enable software engineering agents. What this looks like in practice is an agent-like feature inside developer environments that developers can ask specific sets of coding tasks to be performed in the form of a natural language prompt. This enables the human/machine partnership.\n\nThat being said, to only focus on code generation is to miss the variety of ways AI can help software developers. For example, Thoughtworks has been interested in how generative AI can be used to understand legacy codebases, and we see a lot of promise in tools like Unblocked, which is an AI team assistant that helps teams do just that. In fact, Anthropic’s Claude Code helped us add support for new languages in an internal tool, CodeConcise. We use CodeConcise to understand legacy systems; and while our success was mixed, we do think there’s real promise here.\n\nTightening practices to better leverage AI\n\nIt’s important to remember much of the work developers do isn’t developing something new from scratch. A large proportion of their work is evolving and adapting existing (and sometimes legacy) software. Sprawling and janky code bases that have taken on technical debt are, unfortunately, the norm. Simply applying AI will likely make things worse, not better, especially with approaches like vibe. \n\nThis is why developer judgment will become more critical than ever. In the latest edition of the Technology Radar report, AI-friendly code design is highlighted, based on our experience that AI coding assistants perform best with well-structured codebases. \n\nIn practice, this requires many different things, including clear and expressive naming to ensure context is clearly communicated (essential for code maintenance), reducing duplicate code, and ensuring modularity and effective abstractions. Done together, these will all help make code more legible to AI systems.\n\nGood coding practices are all too easy to overlook when productivity and effectiveness are measured purely in terms of output, and even though this was true before there was AI tooling, software development needs to focus on good coding first.\n\nAI assistance demands greater human responsibility\n\nInstagram co-founder Mike Krieger recently claimed that in three years software engineers won’t write any code: they will only review AI-created code. This might sound like a huge claim, but it’s important to remember that reviewing code has always been a major part of software development work. With this in mind, perhaps the evolution of software development won’t be as dramatic as some fear.\n\nBut there’s another argument: as AI becomes embedded in how we build software, software developers will take on more responsibility, not less. This is something we’ve discussed a lot at Thoughtworks: the job of verifying that an AI-built system is correct will fall to humans. Yes, verification itself might be AI-assisted, but it will be the role of the software developer to ensure confidence. \n\nIn a world where trust is becoming highly valuable — as evidenced by the emergence of the chief trust officer — the work of software developers is even more critical to the infrastructure of global industry. It’s vital software development is valued: the impact of thoughtless automation and pure vibes could prove incredibly problematic (and costly) in the years to come.\n\nThis content was produced by Thoughtworks.

They’re an essential part of every machine and every system that moves energy,” says William King, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and one of the authors of the new study. Existing designs tend to favor straight lines, right angles, and round tubes, he adds. \n\nKing and his colleagues used 3D printing to design a heat exchanger that includes features to optimize heat movement, like wavy walls and pyramid-shaped bumps, which wouldn’t be possible to make using traditional manufacturing techniques. \n\nThe team had set out to design a system based on a common refrigerant called R-134a, which is commonly used in devices like air conditioners and refrigerators. When cold water lowers the temperature of the refrigerant, it changes from a gas to a liquid on its path through the device. That liquid refrigerant can then go on to other parts of the cooling system, where it’s used to lower the temperature of anything from a room to a rack of servers. \n\nThe best way to cool the refrigerant tends to involve building very thin walls between the two sides of the device and maximizing the amount of contact that the water and the refrigerant make with those walls. (Think about how much colder you’d get wearing a thin T-shirt and pants and lying down on ice than simply touching it with your gloved hands.)\n\nTo design the best possible heat exchanger, researchers used simulations and developed machine-learning models to help predict the performance of different designs under different conditions. After 36,000 simulations, the researchers landed on the one they decided to develop.\n\nAmong the key components: small fins that jut out on the side of the device that touches the water, increasing the surface area to maximize heat transfer. The team also designed wavy passageways for the water to pass through—once again helping to maximize surface area. Simulations helped the researchers figure out exactly how curvy the passages should be and where precisely to place the fins.\n\nOn the side of the devices where the refrigerant passes through, the design includes small pyramid-shaped bumps along the walls. These not only maximize the area for cooling but also help mix the refrigerant as it passes through and prevent liquid from coating the wall (which would slow down the heat transfer).\n\nAfter settling on a design, the researchers used a 3D-printing technique called direct metal laser sintering, in which lasers melt and fuse together a metal powder (in this case, an aluminum alloy), layer by layer.\n\nIn testing, the researchers found that the heat exchanger created with this technique was able to cool down the refrigerant more efficiently than other designs. The new device was able to achieve a power density of over six megawatts per meter cubed—outperforming one common traditional design, the shell-tube configuration, by between 30% and 50% with the same pumping power. The device’s power density was similar to that of brazed plate heat exchangers, another common design in industry. \n\nOverall, this device doesn’t dramatically outperform the state-of-the-art technology, but the technique of using modeling and 3D printing to produce new heat exchanger designs is promising, says Dennis Nasuta, director of research and development at Optimized Thermal Systems, a consulting firm that works with companies in the HVAC industry on design and research. “It’s worth exploring, and I don’t think that we know yet where we can push it,” Nasuta says.\n\nOne challenge is that today, additive manufacturing techniques such as laser sintering are slow and expensive compared with traditional manufacturing; they wouldn’t be economical or feasible to rely on for all our consumer cooling devices, he says. For now, this type of approach could be most useful in niche applications like aerospace and high-end automotives, which could more likely bear the cost, he adds. \n\nThis particular study was funded by the US Office of Naval Research. Next-generation ships have more electronics aboard than ever, and there’s a growing need for compact and efficient systems to deal with all that extra heat, says Nenad Miljkovic, one of the authors of the study. \n\nEnergy demand for cooling buildings alone is set to double between now and 2050, and new designs could help efficiently meet the massive demand forecast for the coming decades. But challenges including manufacturing costs would need to be overcome to help innovations like the one designed by King and his team make a dent in real devices.\n\nAnother barrier to adopting these new techniques, Nasuta says, is that current standards don’t demand more efficiency. Other technologies already exist that could help make our devices more efficient, but they’re not used for the same reason. \n\nIt will take time for new manufacturing techniques, including 3D printing, to trickle into our devices, Natsua adds: “This isn’t going to be in your AC next year.”",

The software will also be sector-specific when it&#8217;s released more widely in the first quarter of next year. \n\nThe company first came together this past summer led by Petraeus, who joined the U.S. Reserve Officers&#8217; Training Corps to help defray the cost of her Ivy League education and wound up spending seven years in the U.S. Army, including as a civil affairs officer, before co-founding an online meals marketplace, then spending a year with McKinsey & Co. to get a better handle on how businesses are run. \n\nPetraeus says that across her experience, and particularly in the Army, she had &#8220;great leaders&#8221; who were &#8220;thoughtful about their [reports&#8217;] development goals and what was happening in their personal lives, and brought out the best in their people, rather than making them feel less than or marginalized.&#8221; \n\nStill, she was aware that from an institutional standpoint, most harassment training is not thoughtful, that it&#8217;s a matter of checking boxes on an annual basis to ensure compliance with different state laws, depending on where an organization is headquartered. She marveled that so much of the content employees are consuming seems &#8220;designed for a 1980s law firm.&#8221; \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nCasstime, a four-year-old, Shenzhen, China-based auto aftermarket procurement platform, has raised $80 million in Series C-1 funding co-led by Sequoia Capital China and Source Code Capital, with participation from earlier backer Hua Partners.

But I also knew from our own experience in struggling to raise money the need for more capital in Utah, and I thought having that operator-entrepreneur perspective could be useful.” \n\nA first fund, like many in the industry, was more of an experiment, though it was a decent $23 million, thanks largely to the support of Chegg CEO Dan Rosensweig, who was early to commit capital to the fund. A second ($56 million) fund followed when Krommenhoek and John Mayfield — a friend who joined him from a marketing role at Qualtrics — began investing more seriously in their backyard and beyond. \n\nThey were soon joined by a third investor, Diogo Myrrha, who began as a principal with the firm and is now a general partner.

Then he really began to bounce around. Park worked as a trader in New York out of college, embraced the ski-bum life in Utah, then headed to Asia for Uber, where he spent six years, running its expansion team, then managing its entire Southeast Asia business out of Singapore. \n\nMore specifically, he was responsible for eight countries across the region, and 350 people, which didn’t give him a lot of time to organize his home. But he wasn’t overwhelmed by the chaos. Instead, he says that in Singapore, something unusual happened. “There’s this huge culture of landlords furnishing space to attract expats,” explains Park. “The furnishings aren’t super high-end, but they’re well-designed and well put together, and it enabled me to be basically moved in as soon as I put my clothes in the closet.” Suddenly, coming home was a treat — a new sensation for him. “For the first time, I was proud to host friends for dinners and barbecues and to just open the door and relax.” \n\nPark knew his U.S. friends could benefit from the same experience, and before long, he was talking with his Dartmouth classmate turned product and industrial designer Christian Talmage about forming their own company. Enter Oliver Space, which provides a lot of what that Singaporean landlord delivered to Park. It furnishes places for busy professionals, making moving into a new home as easy as hanging up their clothes. \n\nThe now year-old service is available in the Bay Area only. And Oliver Space employs just a dozen people so far. But the company has already gained enough traction to attract $6.8 million in seed funding from an interesting array of investors, including Mayfield, Abstract Ventures, investors Jana Messerschmidt and April Underwood, Opendoor founder Eric Wu, and Kevin and Julia Hartz of Eventbrite, among others. \n\nNow, Oliver Space just has to grow as quickly, or more so, than other furniture-as-service startups to recently attract funding. \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nGreensill, an eight-year-old, London-based provider of working capital and supply chain finance, has raised $655 million in new funding from earlier backer SoftBank Vision Fund.

The contract could be worth as much as $10 billion over a decade. Donald Trump had expressed opposition to giving the lucrative award to a company led by sometimes nemesis Jeff Bezos, who has suggested sending Trump into space. In a statement announcing the award, the Defense Department said: “The acquisition process was conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.” All parties “were treated fairly and evaluated consistently with the solicitation’s stated evaluation criteria,” said the statement. “We’re surprised about this conclusion,” Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said in a separate statement. “AWS is the clear leader in cloud computing, and a detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings clearly lead to a different conclusion.” The Washington Post has more here.\n\nSponsored By . . .\n\nGot funding?

Let&#8217;s talk.\n\nVC Ben Horowitz on WeWork, Uber and One Cultural Value His Employees Can&#8217;t Break\n\nBen Horowitz, the co-founder of the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, has a new book coming out this coming Monday titled “What You Do is Who You Are,” that takes a look at how to create “culture” at a company. \n\nIt’s a word that’s thrown around a lot but that&#8217;s very hard to grasp, let alone implement in a sustainable way. Horowitz learned firsthand as a CEO how elusive it can be when he took stock of his company, only to discover it was made up of “screamers who intimidated their people,” others who “neglected to give any feedback,” and at least one compulsive liar who excelled at sucking up to Horowitz and also making up stories from whole cloth. \n\nHorowitz says creating culture was a missing part of his education, and in this new book — a follow-up to his best-selling “The Hard Thing About Hard Things” — he does his best to fill that gap for other CEOs, using his own experience, as well as lessons gleaned from historical figures Toussaint Louverture and Genghis Khan, along with Shaka Senghor, a contemporary who served time for murder and today is a criminal justice reform advocate. \n\nIt’s an instructive and novel combination, and we suggest picking up the book, especially if you love history. In the meantime, we sat down recently with Horowitz to talk about its timing and whether some of the biggest cultural blow-ups in the startup industry — Uber and WeWork — could have been avoided. These excerpts have been edited for length and clarity. Note that we’ll have more of the conversation — including Horowitz’s thoughts about dual-class shares — for readers of Extra Crunch on Monday. \n\nYou’ve just written a book about culture that’s coming out just as a lot of questions are being raised about culture because of WeWork. What happened there? \n\n[Cofounder Adam Neumann] had a certain kind of culture there. He had some holes — some great strengths and great holes. And sometimes that happens. When you’re really good at part of it, you can delude yourself into thinking that you’ve got everything you need when you have some massive incompleteness. \n\nAdam is so amazing. Like, the way they got all the money and everything. And the vision was so spectacular. And everybody there believed it, and they recruited some phenomenal talent. But when you’re that optimistic, it does help to have something in the culture that says [allows] people to bring you the bad news, like, if the accounting is all over the place or what have you. \n\nAs with Uber’s Travis Kalanick, whose culture also came under fire, Neumann operated in very plain sight. He wasn’t hiding who he was or what he was spending. \n\nRight, everybody knew how Travis was running the company. Everyone in Silicon Valley knew, let alone everyone on the board. The culture was published. You can look up Uber’s values [from that period]. \n\nTravis designed, I think, a really compelling culture, and believed in it, and published it. And the consequences of what he was missing were also super well-known. It’s only when board members think people are coming after them that [they take an interest in these things]. \n\nWhat are the biggest lessons in these two cases? \n\nI obviously know more about Uber [as a Lyft investor who follows the space]. In Uber’s case, it’s a very subtle thing. Travis had a really good code. But he had a bug in it. \n\nI think it was reported that, like, Travis encouraged bad behavior. I don’t think he did at all. I just think he didn’t make it clear that legal and ethical [considerations] were more important than competitiveness. As a result, when left to their own devices, in a distributed organization where there was a lot of distributed power, that combination had people doing things that were out of bounds. \n\nAnd he was making everybody so much money. And the company was growing so fast that, for the board members, I suspect they were like, ‘As long as it’s making money, I’m not going to worry about what happens next.’ \n\nTo me, the unfair part is, like, they shouldn’t get any credit at the end. Whatever you’re blaming Travis for [you should blame them, too] because they didn’t see it, either. I think that’s a charitable way of putting it. \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nFountain Medical, a 12-year-old, Beijing, China-based contract research organization for pharma, has raised $62 million in Series D funding led by Goldman Sachs, with participation from Lilly Asia Ventures.

There’s no more days needed to go fundraising. There’s no more days needed to go prove to the investor community that we’re a viable company. The size of the commitment that SoftBank has made to this company in the past and now is $18.5 billion. To put the things in context, that is bigger than the GDP of my country where I came from. That’s a country where there’s 11 million people.” \n\nClaure, a native of Bolivia who was named chairman as part of SoftBank’s rescue of the beleaguered co-working company, has been a SoftBank lieutenant for the last five years, and currently holds a variety of titles on its behalf, including COO of SoftBank Group Corp, CEO of SoftBank Group International and CEO of SoftBank Latin America. \n\nHe has said he first met SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son after building up his own business, Brightstar — a cellphone reseller — then selling 57% of it to SoftBank in 2013 in a deal that valued the company at $2.2 billion. SoftBank later acquired more of the company before deciding to explore a sale of the low-margin business last year for $1 billion. \n\nBy then, Claure was running Sprint, a SoftBank-backed property that installed Claure as CEO in 2014, where he presided over a massive share slide that began before he joined the company and ended only last year when T-Mobile and Sprint agreed to merge. \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nArcutis Biotherapeutics, a three-year-old, Westlake Village, Ca.-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that wants to commercialize treatments for immune-mediated dermatological diseases and conditions, has raised $94.5 million in Series C funding.

Over the years, we&#8217;ve mistakenly believed that a number of founders have obtained specific college degrees based on their LinkedIn bio, only to learn offline that they enrolled for some period of time in a particular program that they didn&#8217;t complete. \n\nIt happened most recently with the cofounder of a startup who one would might surmise based on his LinkedIn profile has a master&#8217;s degree from Harvard but does not. We also misunderstood the CEO of a robotics company to have a PhD based on her LinkedIn. It was our fault; it mentioned under the credit that she&#8217;d left to start a company.

Headquartered in Austin with senior-level talent in San Francisco, we are a PR agency with expertise in funding launches. Our VC Portfolio Funding Launch Accelerator Program is a 5-week sprint that ensures your funding news gets the business & tech press coverage it deserves. Beyond funding, we collaborate with both startups and enterprises to meet your business goals (with 15 exits under our belt). Interested? Let&#8217;s talk.\n\nHave We Reached the Tipping Point?\n\nLimited partners or LPs &#8212; the pension funds, the university endowments, the family offices that largely provide venture firms with their spending money &#8212; are receiving a lot of attention from venture capitalists, some of it unwanted. VCs have begun knocking down their doors with requests for fresh capital commitments so they&#8217;ll have money to invest if the market cools down. \n\nThe problem is, many of these LPs are already over-allocated. LPs traditionally invest in many asset classes, such as public equities, and they allocate a small percentage of their portfolio to venture capital. Suddenly, they&#8217;re finding they&#8217;ve forked over more than they&#8217;d intended to VCs. \n\nThere are several reasons for this situation. First, VCs are returning to them ever faster for more capital &#8212; sometimes in less than two years&#8217; time &#8212; because they are in vesting at such a furious pace. \n\nCompounding the problem, not all LPs have received returns from their VC investments that they can recycle into new venture capital allocations. In some cases, this capital is still tied up in startups that are raising much more money than in the past and staying private longer. &#8220;We have some large exposures to blue chip names where IPOs have been rumored to be coming for a long time already, and now it&#8217;s maybe 2021, maybe 2022,&#8221; says one manager who asked not to be named. In other cases where startups have gone public, falling prices have prompted VCs to hang on to their shares instead of distribute them. \n\nThe result is that LPs are having to cut back on the number of managers they can fund, and that could mean bad news for venture capitalists and startups alike. These LPs don&#8217;t have much choice. As the LP explains it, &#8220;We have a pretty structured allocation process, and we&#8217;re really trying to be creative,&#8221; she says. One venture manager who reappeared too quickly for more money was &#8220;easy to walk away from,&#8221; says this person. &#8220;Others, we&#8217;re having to do financial backflips for them to remain strong partners.&#8221; Either way, this LP adds, &#8220;We can&#8217;t add any new relationships right now,&#8221; meaning new venture teams in particular are out of luck. &#8220;When [VCs] shorten their fundraising cycle by nine months to a year, you can only squeeze the balloon so much.&#8221; \n\nSoftBank&#8217;s $100 billion &#8220;Vision Fund&#8221; is one big reason LPs find themselves in their current predicament. From the moment SoftBank began waving money around several years ago, it launched a vicious cycle. According to Chris Douvos, whose investment firm, Ahoy Capital, owns stakes in such venture funds as True Ventures and First Round Capital, &#8220;When Andreessen Horowitz hit the scene a decade ago, they changed the tempo of investing and everyone got more aggressive in their dealmaking as a response. Then SoftBank entered the picture in a big way, and it was like a16z on steroids.&#8221; \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nBlueground, a six-year-old, New York-based startup providing turnkey flexible rental apartments, has raised $50 million in Series B funding, roughly six months after raising $20 million in Series A funding.

TechCrunch has more here.\n\nSmaller Fundings  \n\nTenfold, a four-year-old, Austin, Tex.-based maker of customer service software, has raised $7.5 million in Series C funding led by Next Coast Ventures, with participation from earlier backers Andreessen Horowitz, Geekdom Fund, and Salesforce Ventures. Pulse 2.0 has more here.\n\nNew Funds \n\nBloomberg Beta, the six-year-old, San Francisco-based outfit that uses Bloomberg LP’s money to make bets on startups, has closed its third fund with $75 million, according to Roy Bahat, who’d previously run the online media company IGN and who operates the fund as an equal partnership with Karin Klein and James Chan. (Klein formerly ran Bloomberg’s new initiatives; Chan was formerly a principal with Trinity Ventures.) We talked with Bahat briefly last night about the new vehicle to ask how its capital will be deployed.\n\nExits \n\nThe Kik messaging platform has been bought by MediaLab, a holding company which operates Whisper and a number of other apps, the company announced earlier today. CoinDesk has more here.\n\nPeople \n\nDi-Ann Eisnor, a WeWork exec, has left the company, says The Information. Eisnor reported to Adam Neumann and had &#8220;hired a group of designers, researchers and engineers focused on urban problems such as housing affordability and constructing buildings with sustainable material,&#8221; says the outlet, adding that her team of about 30 employees have left the company or are planning to depart.  \n\nBill Gates on why he thinks we can predict the future. \n\nIlana Stern has joined Peterson Ventures as general partner.

    "content": "Update: the CTO of TradingView told Cointelegraph in comments that the reports of a bug were inaccurate, and the Twitter user partially withdrew his earlier claims that the tool was broken. Popular chart analysis service TradingView reportedly contains a bug in the Fibonacci retracement technical analysis tool, according to a tweet by self-proclaimed certified Elliott wave analyst Cryptoteddybear published on June 13. The Elliott wave principle is a type of technical analysis for predicting prices in financial markets by looking at recurring patterns. In a video that he uploaded to YouTube, the analyst explains that the tool does linear calculations when in logarithmic charts, which he notes is a significant issue for Elliot wave traders. The official Twitter account of the company behind the charting service answered his tweet, announcing that the issue is being investigated, to which Cryptoteddybear answered: &ldquo;Thank you @tradingview for finally taking this issue seriously.&rdquo; The first reports of the bug, posted over five years ago (in November 2014) on consumer community platform getsatisfaction, have been reportedly ignored by the company. Another report submitted on the same platform, dated June 3, 2017, has seen the official TradingView account answer in the thread: &ldquo;Hi, you are right, we have a planned task to fix this. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.&rdquo; However, the problem apparently has not yet been solved. Cryptoteddybear claims that a company representative told him that he asked the technicians to increase the priority given to solving the bug. As Cointelegraph recently reported, TradingView is one of the platforms that added the &ldquo;CIX100&rdquo; index &mdash; an AI-powered index for the 100 strongest-performing cryptocurrencies and tokens. At the beginning of the current month, cryptocurrency analytics company Coin Metrics announced that it has acquired digital asset index firm Bletchley Indexes and plans to launch crypto smart beta indexes. As of press time, TradingView has not responded to a request for comment.",
