Are you confused on how they differ from round squares? You're not alone.\n\nDesigners are often confused by the differences between squircles and round squares. In short — squircles are a combination of a circle and square — as the name suggests —  while round squares are simply rounded-off versions of regular squares. \n\nIf you try to imagine these two different shapes in your mind, they probably look nearly identical. But understanding the slight nuances between these two shapes is important in order to determine how and where to use each one in your designs. \n\nLet’s take a closer look. \n\nIt all begins with a rounded square\n\nTo understand squircles, the first step is understanding rounded squares — the proverbial starting point for creating a squircle. \n\nA rounded square is a square with rounded corners. Instead of the sharp corners you would find with a plain old square, you replace them with curved edges like you see in the image below. \n\nWhat’s important to note here is that besides the curved corners, nothing else about a rounded square deviates from a normal square. Like a square, the edges are straight and sharp, transitioning starkly from the curvature of the corners. \n\nWhat is a squircle?\n\nNow, let’s bring in the squircle. Like rounded squares, they have curved corners, but they’re ever so slightly different. \n\nAs you can see in the picture above, a squircle looks very similar to a rounded square. However, unlike a rounded square, where the curved corner transitions directly into a straight line˜— the line and the corner both gently curve together to form a slightly more circular and rounded shape. \n\nSquircles have long been an integral part of design and have been used for everything from the shape of Apple iOS applications and speedometers in Fiat cars to dinner plates and pots and pans. \n\nSquircles have been even used as traffic circles and roundabouts — most notably by Dutch polymath Piet Hein to help decongest the city of Stockholm after the Second World War. \n\nThe difference between a squircle and a rounded square \n\nAs we mentioned above, a squircle and a rounded square may look similar but they are two distinct shapes.\n\nThe main difference between these two shapes lies in their angles; whereas the corners of a rounded square remain 90-degrees, the edges of a squircle curve smoothly outwards from each corner, forming an arc.\n\nThe easiest way to visualize their difference is on a chart. If a square anchors on one end of the axis, and a circle on the other end — the rounded square would be more comparable to a square and the squircle would be more comparable to the circle as shown below. \n\nWe love how Daniel Furst, senior software engineer at Curative and ex-Figma engineer,  describes the difference between squircles and rounded squares in his piece Desperately Seeking Squircles:\n\n“The curvature of a squircle’s perimeter is continuous, whereas a rounded square’s is not,” says Daniel. “This may seem trivial, a cool story, but subconsciously it really makes a big impact: a squircle doesn’t look like a square with surgery performed on it; it registers as an entity in its own right, like the shape of a smooth pebble in a riverbed, a unified and elemental whole.” \n\nWhich one should I use — a squircle or a rounded square? \n\nSo, you might be wondering — which one should I use in my next design? The answer: it depends. \n\nIn Orana Velarde’s Flaticon blog “The Meaning of Round Corners,” humans seem to have a psychological aversion to sharp edges. Sharp edges are established as dangerous, painful and negative. Orana says, “Beyond psychology, curves also enjoy better visual perception. When you look at two-dimensional shapes, those with curves are perceived faster than those with sharp lines.The fact that our brain captures the information of curves faster than right-angled corners ensures that emotionally we do the same. That’s why we prefer curves.”\n\nBoth shapes provide the curves and roundness that the human eye finds friendly and inviting. However, a squircle’s natural curvature makes the shape friendlier and easier on the eyes. This is because a squircle doesn’t contain the sharp and sudden breaks of a rounded square and instead your eyes are allowed to continuously follow the curvature of the shape.\n\nDespite this, many users and designers alike find this difference negligible — making the best choice completely based on personal preference and what works best with your overall design. \n\nSquircle Resources for Designers\n\nIf you’re looking to learn more about this delightful shape or use it in a project, here’s a roundup of some of our favorite resources to check out.  \n\nCircling the Square: Designing with “Squircles” Instead of Rounded Rectangles by Kurt Kohlstedt \nSquircle on Wikipedia: \nThe Hunt for the Squircle by Michael Flarup\nThe Squircle by Wolfram Mathworld\nJohn D Cook’s Blog discussing the history of the term and the curvature of the squircle \nDesperately Seeking Squircles by Daniel Furse.

    "title": "KubeCon Europe 2025: Edera Protect Offers a Secure Container",
    "content": "We’re so glad you’re here. You can expect all the best TNS content to arrive \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMonday through Friday to keep you on top of the news and at the top of your game.\n\nCheck your inbox for a confirmation email where you can adjust your preferences \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand even join additional groups.\n\nCheck out the latest featured and trending stories while you wait for your \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst TNS newsletter.\n\nLONDON — Edera, a pioneering company in cloud native security, released Edera Protect 1.0 at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe, hosted at the Excel London convention center at Royal Victoria Dock. This container security program is designed to address the tension between platform velocity and security. The program’s innovative approach ensures strong isolation between containers by default, eliminating entire classes of threats at the architectural level, unlike traditional solutions that focus on detection and monitoring.\n\nIt sounds wonderful, but just how will Edera pull it off, you ask? Protect does this by being written in memory-safe Rust on top of the open source type-1, bare-metal virtual machine (VM) hypervisor, Xen. This hypervisor was selected, as Edera CIO and Alpine Linux maintainer Ariadne Conill explained in an email interview, because unlike KVM, which runs inside the Linux kernel, it’s a dedicated secure hypervisor. These are inherently safer than the popular type-2 hypervisors.\n\nNow you may be wondering what a hypervisor, which is all about VMs (not containers), is doing in a cloud native package? The answer is that the Edera team took the hypervisor design and shifted it over to containers.\n\nAs Emily Long, Edera’s CEO, said, “Hypervisors haven’t been reimagined for nearly two decades and just don’t work in the cloud native world.” So her developers built a 21st-century hypervisor, Krata. Krata is a Xen-based, single-host hypervisor built for Open Container Initiative (OCI)-compliant containers. It isolates containers with a fully memory-safe Rust control plane to bring Xen tooling into a new, secure era. Edera also uses Lukko, an open source, memory safety runtime library. This library detects memory safety violations at runtime and terminates programs with extreme prejudice before they can be exploited.\n\nWith this release, Edera has also open sourced Styrolite. This workload lifecycle manager, used in Protect, leverages Linux kernel namespaces to provide lightweight sandboxes for workloads to run in. It also provides low-level primitives suitable for implementing a Container Runtime Interface (CRI) Linux container runtime built from scratch.\n\nEdera has also joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and The Linux Foundation, pledging to contribute significantly to the open source community with each major product release.\n\nWhat all this adds up to is that Edera Protect provides full isolation between containers, maintaining performance and efficiency while ensuring security. It supports multiple containers within a single zone, offering flexibility without compromising security boundaries. The company claims in its benchmarks that Edera Protect has achieved more than 250 secure zones on a single Kubernetes node.\n\nIn addition, Protect integrates seamlessly with existing Kubernetes infrastructure in minutes and scales to tens of thousands of nodes, enhancing resource utilization and security posture without disrupting workflows.\n\nThe program also includes support for fully isolated file system sharing, integration with the Cilium container network interface for advanced networking, and comprehensive observability features such as Prometheus metrics.\n\nLooking ahead, Edera plans to expand Edera Protect with support for boundaries at the Kubernetes namespace layer and deeper integration with cloud provider security features. This milestone marks the beginning of a journey to make secure containers the industry standard for cloud native computing.\n\nIn related developments, Eedera continued to enhance Linux memory security, with initiatives like OpenPax aiming to improve memory safety through patches. Many companies like to say security is job one; in Edra’s case, they mean what they say.\n\nCommunity created roadmaps, articles, resources and journeys for developers to help you choose your path and grow in your career.",

    "content": "Apple Stock Falls as Trump Tariffs Target Supply Chain\nWednesday April 2, 2025 4:26 pm PDT by Juli Clover\n\nApple's efforts to diversify its supply chain may have been for naught with the Trump administration's new tariffs that target multiple countries where Apple sources components for its iPhones, iPads, and Macs.\n\n\nApple has worked to move some of its manufacturing to countries like India, Vietnam, and Thailand, all of which are facing steep tariffs in addition to China and Taiwan. There is a minimum 10 percent tariff for all U.S. trading partners, and \"reciprocal tariffs\" on several countries where Apple suppliers are located. Some of the tariffs:\n\nVietnam - 46%\nThailand - 36%\nChina - 34%\nTaiwan - 32%\nIndia - 26%\nJapan - 24%\nMalaysia - 24%\nEU - 20%\n\nAs The New York Times notes, Apple is already contending with a 20 percent tariff in China, which is set to increase significantly. Taiwan, where Apple sources the Apple silicon chips that go into all of its devices, is facing a 32 percent tariff.\n\nThe last time Trump was in office, Apple was able to get tariff exemptions or avoid tariffs entirely for some products, but Trump claims that he will not provide exemptions this time around. Morgan Stanley estimates that devices imported from China will cost Apple an additional $8.5 billion annually without exemptions, though it is not clear if Apple would pass those costs to consumers with price increases.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has said in the past that the United States is not able to compete with China and other countries when it comes to manufacturing due to a lack of skilled workers with expertise in advanced tooling.\n\nApple stock is down 7.5 percent in after hours trading after the tariff announcements. The tariffs will go into effect on April 9, according to Trump.\n\nNote: Due to the political or social nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our Political News forum.

Three people died.\n\nListen to this article · 4:41 min Learn more\nShare full article\nXiaomi’s founder and chief executive, Lei Jun, during the launch of a new vehicle model in Beijing last month.\nCredit...\nTingshu Wang/Reuters\n\nBy Daisuke Wakabayashi and Claire Fu\n\nApril 1, 2025\n阅读简体中文版閱讀繁體中文版\n\nChina’s Xiaomi, a consumer electronics giant turned automaker, said it was cooperating with a police investigation into a fatal crash involving one of its electric vehicles while the driver was using the car’s autonomous driving features.\n\nA Xiaomi SU7 sedan drove into a concrete guardrail on an expressway in eastern China late Saturday at around 60 miles per hour, according to a post on Xiaomi’s official social media account. On Tuesday, local media published reports about the collision and ensuing fire, which killed three college students, along with pictures of the charred remains of the vehicle.\n\nXiaomi said the driver had deployed the company’s Navigate On Autopilot, an assisted-driving feature, while going around 70 m.p.h. on the expressway. The car was traveling at that speed when it reached a roadblock, because a portion of the road was under repair with traffic diverted into a different lane.\n\nSeconds before the collision, the car warned that there were obstacles ahead and started to decelerate, but it was too late. The company said it had called the police and emergency services.\n\nThe fatal crash took place one year after the launch of Xiaomi’s SU7 electric vehicle, a major shift for a company that had gained a cultlike following for its smartphones and home appliances. And the SU7, which bears a resemblance to the Porsche Taycan at a fraction of the price, has been a breakthrough success in China’s cutthroat electric vehicle market. It sold more than 200,000 units in its first year.\n\nThe ability of a company with no automotive experience to build and sell a car capable of gaining market share so quickly is a testament to the advantages of China’s supply chain of batteries and key components for electric vehicles. It is also a warning to the automotive industry that the competition is no longer limited to traditional car brands but open to almost any company adept at manufacturing electronic products efficiently and inexpensively.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Intel's Arc B580 revealed that it's still possible to make a mid-range GPU with more than 8 GB of VRAM. AMD's RDNA 4 marked the continuation of a longstanding AMD practice where they reach for the top-end, before deciding it wasn't worth it after all. Nvidia too has a new generation to celebrate 2025, and their 5000 series launch has come and gone without cards on shelves. But bigger numbers are better, so it's time to talk about the GeForce 6 series.\n\nGamers demand higher quality graphics with each generation. No one knows this better than Nvidia, so GeForce 6000 series cards are built to deliver near-cinematic quality at framerates high enough to support interactive gameplay. GeForce 6000 GPUs, or the GeForce 6 series for short, are built with the highly parallel nature of graphics rendering in mind. At the same time, they take a great leap forward in terms of programmability, opening up exciting new possibilities for complex in-game effects.\n\nOverview\n\nGraphics rendering involves transforming vertex coordinates from 3D space to 2D screen space before calculating the final pixel colors, a process known as rasterization. Both stages are inherently parallel tasks, and map well to hardware with large arrays of execution units. Accordingly, a GeForce 6 series GPU is a massively parallel machine. It has a strong complement of fixed-function graphics hardware, but the real power of the GPU lies in a collection of vertex and pixel shader cores. These programmable components execute shader programs provided by the game instead of carrying out preset functions. They also serve as basic building blocks, letting Nvidia scale to different power, price, and performance targets. The highest end GeForce 6000 series chip, NV40, implements 6 vertex shader and 16 pixel shader cores.\n\nFrom Nvidia’s IEEE paper\n\nA highly parallel machine needs a high bandwidth memory subsystem to keep it fed. GeForce 6 series products can feature up to a 256-bit GDDR3 DRAM setup, giving it significantly more memory bus width than typical desktop CPUs. The GPU features a L2 texture cache shared across all pixel and vertex shader cores, which enables short-term reuse of fetched texture data. Nvidia did not disclose cache sizes at this time, but they aim for a 90% hitrate with many misses in flight, rather than the 99% hitrate one often sees with CPU caches. The GPU communicates with the host system via the popular AGP interface, but can also support the upcoming PCI Express standard.\n\nVertex Shader Core\n\nVertex shader programs transform coordinates from 3D to 2D screen space. It may sound like a trivial task that involves little more than a camera matrix multiplication and perspective division. But programmable vertex shaders open up new tricks. For example, a vertex shader can sample a texture and use it as a displacement map. Besides supporting texture accesses, GeForce 6000's vertex shader cores support branches, loops, and function calls. Much of this capability was previously unthinkable on anything outside a real CPU, demonstrating the exciting nature of GPU evolution.\n\nVertex shader execution starts with instruction fetch from a 512-entry instruction RAM. Nvidia uses 128-bit vertex instructions from the driver format, which are translated into a 123-bit internal format. Thus the instruction RAM has approximately 8 KB of capacity. DirectX 9's vertex shader 3.0 standard mandates a minimum of 512 instruction slots, and Nvidia's vertex shader core ISA is closely aligned to DirectX 9's HLSL instructions. Thanks to instruction limits, shader programs are immune to performance losses from instruction cache misses, which CPU programs can often suffer. Furthermore, accessing the instruction RAM doesn't involve tag comparisons like a cache would, saving power.\n\nGeForce 6000 Vertex Shader instruction layout, inferred from Mesa code\n\nDirectX 9 vertex shader HLSL instructions broadly fall into scalar and vector categories. Scalar instructions include special operations like inverse square roots. Vector instructions generally involve basic operations like multiply-add, and operate on 128-bit vectors of four 32-bit values. GeForce 6000's vertex shader pipeline is highly optimized for this arrangement, and features separate vector and scalar pipelines. Each ISA instruction specifies both a scalar and vector operation, letting the vertex shader core exploit parallelism in two dimensions within one instruction stream. Vectors specified by the DirectX 9 shader program provide vector-level parallelism. Any scalar+vector dual issue opportunities found by Nvidia's compiler provide additional parallelism.\n\nA third source of parallelism comes from multithreading, and serves to hide latency. The vector operation slot can accept texture sampling instructions. Memory accesses from a vertex shader should still be relatively uncommon, so vertex shader cores don't have a L1 texture cache tied to their texture fetch unit. Nvidia expects a shader program will need 20-30 instructions to hide texture fetch latency, which can be hard to achieve from a single thread. Therefore, vertex shader cores can each track up to three threads and switch between them to hide latency.\n\nInstruction inputs can come from registers or constant RAM. Both consist of 128-bit vector entries to match vector execution width. Register files are split into input, output, and temporary registers. The input and output registers each have 16 entries, and are read-only or write-only respectively from the shader program's point of view. The temporary register file supports both reads and writes, and has 32 entries. DirectX 9's vertex shader 3.0 specification lets a shader program address up to 32 registers, but Nvidia might share the register file between multiple threads. If so, a vertex shader program should use no more than 10 temporary registers to achieve maximum occupancy.\n\nPixel Shader Core\n\nPixel shaders, or fragment shaders, do much of the heavy lifting because rendering a scene typically involves processing far more pixels than vertices. Accordingly, a GeForce 6000 GPU can have up to 16 pixel shader cores. The pixel shader cores themselves are highly programmable just like the vertex shader cores, with branching support among other goodies. However, pixel shader cores are built very differently to exploit increased parallelism typically present at the pixel level.\n\nGeForce 6000's pixel shaders use 128-bit instructions, though the encoding is substantially different from the one used in vertex shaders thanks to hardware differences. Nvidia has chosen to support up to 65536 pixel shader instructions, exceeding the DirectX 9 minimum specification of 512 instruction slots by a wide margin. Using all instruction slots would consume 1 MB of storage, so pixel shader cores might use an instruction cache.\n\nThe fragment processor has two fp32 shader units per pipeline, and fragments are routed through both shader units and the branch processor before recirculating through the entire pipeline to execute the next series of instructions\n\nFrom The Geforce 6 Series GPU Architecture, Emmet Kilgariff and Ramdima Fernando\n\nWhere Nvidia's vertex shader core operates much like a CPU with 3-way SMT to hide latency, the pixel shader core uses a SIMD execution model across threads. That parallelism, often referred to as SIMT (Single Instruction Multiple Thread), applies on top of the SIMD you get within a thread from using multi-component vectors. Rather than tracking three separate threads, Nvidia groups many pixel shader invocations into a vector and effectively loops through the \"threads\" in hardware. This approach lets Nvidia keep thousands of \"threads\" in flight at low cost, because threads in the same vector must execute the same instruction and cannot take an independent execution path from other threads. Only the data being processed is different.\n\nProgrammers must pay attention to divergence penalties with this SIMT threading model. If different threads within a vector take different directions on a conditional branch, the pixel shader core will execute both sides of the branch with non-active threads masked off. That contrasts with the vertex shader core's MIMD execution model, which allows penalty free branching even if branch directions diverge across threads running in the same core. Nvidia suggests keeping branches coherent across regions of over 1000 pixels, or approximately 256 2x2 pixel quads, hinting at very long vector lengths.\n\nKeeping that much work in flight is critical to hiding latency, but places pressure on internal chip storage. DirectX 9 lets pixel shaders address 32 temporary registers, which continue to be 128-bits wide. Keeping 256 threads in flight would require 128 KB of register file capacity per pixel shader core, which will not be achieved in GPUs for several years. GeForce 6000 uses smaller register files of unknown size. Nvidia says pixel shader programs can get the maximum number of threads in flight if they use four or fewer 128-bit registers. As ballpark estimate, 256 threads with four registers per thread would require 16 KB of register file capacity.\n\nThe pixel shader core's two 128-bit vector units are placed one after another in different pipeline stages. Both can execute four FP32 operations per cycle, though only the lower one can do multiply-add. The upper one can handle special functions and texture address calculation. Texture operations are issued between the two execution unit stages. Peak FP32 throughput is 12 operations per cycle. That can be achieved for example by issuing a vector FP32 multiply in the upper stage and a FP32 multiply-add in the lower one.\n\nFrom a shader program's perspective, the upper and lower vector units together can complete two vector operations per cycle. Compared to the vertex shader cores, the pixel shader's sequential \"dual issue\" arrangement lets the upper unit forward its results to the lower one. Thus two dependent instructions can \"dual issue\". Besides interleaving instructions for the two vector units, Nvidia's compiler can pack operations that work on different subsets of vector elements into a single instruction, which improves vector unit utilization within a thread. FP16 execution can improve throughput even further. Full 32-bit precision is often not necessary for graphics rendering, especially when it comes to pixel colors. Both vector execution units in the pixel shader core can execute FP16 operations at double rate. Using FP16 also halves register file usage for those values, which in turn can also improve occupancy and therefore latency hiding.\n\nInput registers not drawn, but all shader programs take input registers and write their results to output registers\n\nTexture sampling is an important part of pixel shading, so pixel shader cores get an optimized texture sampling path compared to the vertex shader cores: each core has a L1 texture cache, backed by a chip-wide L2 texture cache.\n\nGoing Beyond Pixel Shading\n\nPixel shader programs normally output pixel colors, but colors are really just numbers. The bulk of GeForce 6000's massive parallel compute power is concentrated in its array of pixel shaders, and having lots of GFLOPs is great for non-pixel things too. Furthermore, the flexibility of the pixel processing pipelines can let creative programmers do just about anything.\n\nFor example, ray tracing is a fundamentally different approach to graphics rendering (compared to rasterization), that involves tracing light rays through a scene. Ray tracing was largely confined to offline applications because of its compute power requirements. However, GeForce 6's programmable pixel shaders are up to the task of real-time rendering, at least for simple scenes.\n\nFrom Stanford's presentation on the Brook API\n\nThe possibilities go beyond different graphics rendering techniques. The power of programmable shaders has spurred the development of new GPU programming APIs not directly aimed at graphics. Stanford's Brook API targets general purpose compute on GPUs. Its programming model is tightly tied to the way GPUs are optimized for parallel work. Getting up to speed on such a model can take some getting used to, especially as most programmers have been taught using a serial execution model. But researchers and other developers doing highly parallel and highly regular data processing should take note of these APIs.\n\nDifficulties Remain\n\nSignificant barriers still stand in the way of running any parallel task on a GPU: shader programs access memory through textures bound to it; textures have limited size compared to CPU-side memory allocations; floating-point precision is often lacking compared to a full-spec IEEE 754 implementation; shaders can only execute for a short length of time without stalling the display; textures can't be modified during shader execution, etc.\n\nDevelopers also have to move data between CPU and GPU memory spaces to provide the GPU with data and get the results. The latter can be problematic because GPUs are optimized for presenting pixel shader output as a frame on-screen, before quickly overwriting it with a subsequent frame. Copying data back from the GPU can run into host interface limitations.\n\nNvidia is no doubt aware of these limitations, and is working to address this. GeForce 6 will support the incoming PCI Express standard alongside AGP. PCI Express's increased bandwidth moves the GPU one step closer to being an accessible parallel accelerator.\n\nFinal Words\n\nGeForce 6's pixel and vertex shader pipelines are more flexible than ever, and shows Nvidia is taking programmable shaders seriously. Many of the capabilities introduced in GeForce 6 may seem excessive for current gaming workloads. It's hard to imagine anyone writing a shader hundreds of instructions long with loops, calls and branches mixed in. What GeForce 6's capabilities show is that Nvidia is competing on features beyond basic graphics rendering. It's part of a larger trend arising from the move away from fixed-function hardware, and has exciting implications for GPUs. Perhaps soon, we won't be calling these cards GPUs anymore, considering they can do much more than render graphics.\n\nDespite its programmability, GeForce 6000 GPUs continue to focus strongly on graphics. Nvidia's shader ISA remains closely tied to DirectX 9 specifications, ensuring shader programs in games run well on the hardware. And the hardware is quite powerful; a high-end GeForce 6000 chip has over 200 million transistors. That's made possible by IBM's advanced 130nm process. Providing all that processing power demands serious power delivery too, so high end cards use a pair of molex connectors. Molex connectors are a time-tested standard, with thick pins and wires that can reliably supply power to a variety of peripherals without melting.\n\nIn conclusion, GPUs are advancing at an incredible pace. 2005 is an exciting time to be alive. Graphics rendering technologies are moving in lock-step with the nation's economy towards 2008, and undoubtedly everyone is looking forward to that bright future.\n\nWait, what year is it again? Oh, and happy April Fools!\n\nIf you like the content then consider heading over to the Patreon or PayPal if you want to toss a few bucks to Chips and Cheese.

Then Global Crossing Airlines started expanding into federal deportation flights.\nHuman Struggles: Some flight attendants said they ignored orders not to interact with detainees. “I’d say ‘hola’ back,” said one flight attendant. “We’re not jerks.”\nSafety Concerns: Flight attendants received training in how to evacuate passengers but said they weren’t told how to usher out detainees whose hands and legs were bound by shackles.\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nThe deportation flight was in the air over Mexico when chaos erupted in the back of the plane, the flight attendant recalled. A little girl had collapsed. She had a high fever and was taking ragged, frantic breaths.\n\nThe flight attendant, a young woman who went by the nickname Lala, said she grabbed the plane’s emergency oxygen bottle and rushed past rows of migrants chained at the wrists and ankles to reach the girl and her parents.\n\nBy then, Lala was accustomed to the hard realities of working charter flights for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She’d learned to obey instructions not to look the passengers in the eyes, not to greet them or ask about their well-being. But until the girl collapsed, Lala had managed to escape an emergency.\n\nLala worked for Global Crossing Airlines, the dominant player in the loose network of deportation contractors known as ICE Air. GlobalX, as the charter company is also called, is lately in the news. Two weeks ago, it helped the Trump administration fly hundreds of Venezuelans to El Salvador despite a federal court order blocking the deportations, triggering a showdown that experts fear could become a full-blown constitutional crisis.\n\nIn interviews with ProPublica, Lala and six other current and former GlobalX flight attendants provided a window into a part of the deportation process that is rarely seen and little understood. For migrants who have spent months or years trying to reach this country and live here, it is the last act, the final bit of America they may experience.\n\nAn ICE detainee waves from inside a bus that transported passengers to the airport before departing from Seattle’s Boeing Field on a GlobalX deportation flight in February.

But their stories are consistent with one another. They are also generally consistent with what has been said about ICE Air in legal filings, news accounts, academic research and publicly released copies of the ICE Air Operations Handbook.\n\nThat morning over Mexico, Lala said, the girl’s oxygen saturation level was 70% — perilously low compared with a healthy person’s 95% or higher. Her temperature was 102.3 degrees. The flight had a nurse on contract who worked alongside its security guards. But beyond giving the girl Tylenol, the nurse left the situation in Lala’s hands, she recalled.\n\nLala broke the rule about talking to detainees. The parents told Lala their daughter had a history of asthma. The mom, who Lala said had epilepsy, seemed on the verge of her own medical crisis.\n\nLala placed the oxygen mask on the girl’s face. The nurse removed her socks to keep her from further overheating. Lala counted down the minutes, praying for the girl to keep breathing.\n\nThe stories shared by ICE Air flight attendants paint a different picture of deportations from the one presented to the public, especially under President Donald Trump. On social media, the White House has depicted a military operation carried out with ruthless efficiency, using Air Force C-17s, ICE agents in tactical vests and soldiers in camo.\n\nThe reality is that 85% of the administration’s “removal” flights — 254 flights as of March 21, according to the advocacy group Witness at the Border — have been on charter planes. Military flights have now all but ceased. While there are ICE officers and hired security guards on the charters, the crew members on board are civilians, ordinary people swept up in something most didn’t knowingly sign up for.\n\nWhen the flight attendants joined GlobalX, it was a startup with big plans. It sold investors and new hires alike on a vision of VIP clients, including musicians and sports teams, and luxury destinations, especially in the Caribbean. “You can’t beat the eXperience,” read a company tagline.\n\nA GlobalX post on Facebook recruiting flight attendants in March. Alexandria, Louisiana, is a hub for ICE Air. Credit: Screenshot by ProPublica. Redacted by ProPublica.\n\nBut as the airline grew, more and more of its planes were filled with migrants in chains. Some flight attendants were livid about it.\n\nLast year, an anonymous GlobalX employee sent an all-caps, all-staff screed that ricocheted around the startup. “WHERE IS THE COMPANY GOING?” the email asked. “YOU SIGNED A 5 YEAR CONTRACT WITH ICE? ... WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS BECOMING A PRESTIGE CHARTER AIRLINE?”\n\nOne flight attendant said he kept waiting for the sports teams his new bosses had talked about as he flew deportation routes. “You know, the NFL charters, the NBA charters, whatever the hockey one is …” he said.\n\nA second said his planes’ air conditioning kept breaking — an experience consistent with at least two publicly reported onboard incidents — and their lavatories kept breaking, something another flight attendant reported as well. But the planes kept flying. “They made us flush with water bottles,” he said.\n\nBut the flight attendants were most concerned about their inability to treat their passengers humanely — and to keep them safe. (In 2021, an ICE spokesperson told the publication Capital & Main that the agency “follows best practices when it comes to the security, safety and welfare of the individuals returned to their countries of origin.”)\n\nThey worried about what would happen in an emergency. Could they really get over a hundred chained passengers off the plane in time?\n\n“They never taught us anything regarding the immigration flights,” one said. “They didn’t tell us these people were going to be shackled, wrists to fucking ankles.”\n\n“We have never gotten a clear answer on what we do in an ICE Air evacuation,” another said. “They will not give us an answer.”\n\n“It’s only a matter of time,” a third said, before a deportation flight ends in disaster.\n\nLala didn’t think she had a chance at a flight attendant job. She hadn’t, in truth, remembered applying to GlobalX until a recruiter called to say the startup was coming to her city. “But I guess I did apply through LinkedIn?” she said. She’d been working an office job — long hours, little flexibility — and was looking for something new.\n\nThe job interviews were held at a resort hotel. The room was packed with dozens of aspirants when Lala showed up. After the first round, only about 20 were asked to stay. She couldn’t believe she was one of them. After the second round came a job offer: $26 an hour plus a daily expense allowance. Soon Lala got a uniform: a blue cardigan, a white polo shirt and an eye-catching scarf in cyan and light green.\n\nFor part of her Federal Aviation Administration-mandated four-week training, her class stayed in a motel with a pool at the edge of Miami International Airport. Just across the street, on the fourth floor of a concrete-clad office building ringed by palm trees, was GlobalX’s headquarters.\n\n“In the beginning, we were told that because it’s a charter, it’s only gonna be elites, celebrities,” Lala said. “Everybody was really excited.”\n\nBut flying was not going to be all glitz. The real reason for having flight attendants is safety. GlobalX was certified by the FAA as a Part 121 scheduled air carrier, the same as United or Delta, and it and its crew members were subject to the same strict standards.\n\n“We’re there to evacuate you,” one recruit told ProPublica. “Yes, we make good drinks, but we evacuate you.”\n\nLala’s class practiced water landings in the pool at the nearby Pan Am Flight Academy. They practiced door drills — yelling out commands, shoving open heavy exit doors — in a replica Airbus A320 cabin. They learned CPR and how to put out fires. They took written and physical tests, and if they didn’t score at least 90%, they had to retake them.\n\nThey were reminded, over and over, that their job was a vocation, one with a professional code: No matter who the passengers were, flight attendants were in charge of the cabin, responsible for safety in the air.\n\nLala’s official “airman” certificate arrived from the FAA a few weeks after training was done. She was cleared to fly, ready to see the world.\n\nBut what she would see wasn’t what she signed up for. The company was growing beyond glamorous charters. GlobalX was moving into the deportation business.\n\nHer bosses delivered the news casually, she recalled: “It was like, ‘Oh yeah, we got a government contract.’”\n\nThe new graduates were offered a single posting: Harlingen, Texas. Deportation flights were five days a week, sometimes late into the night. Lala went to Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia and, for refueling, Panama.\n\nA standard flight had more than a dozen private security guards — contractors working for the firm Akima — along with a single ICE officer, two nurses, and a hundred or more detainees. (Akima did not respond to a request for comment.) The guards were in charge of delivering food and water to the detainees and taking them to the lavatories. This left the flight attendants, whose presence was required by the FAA, with little to do.\n\n“Arm and disarm doors, that was our duty,” Lala said.\n\nThe flights had their own set of rules, which the crew members said they learned from a company policy manual or from chief flight attendants. Don’t talk to the detainees. Don’t feed them. Don’t make eye contact. Don’t walk down the aisles without a guard escorting you. Don’t sit in aisle seats, where detainees could get close to you. Don’t wear your company-issued scarf because of “safety concerns that a detainee might grab it and use it against us,” Lala said.\n\n“You don’t do nothing,” said a member of another GlobalX class. “Just sit down in your seats and be quiet.” If a detainee looked at him, he was supposed to look out the window.\n\nA chained detainee boards a GlobalX flight at Seattle’s Boeing Field in February. Credit: Emily Schultz\n\nA rare public statement from the company about life aboard ICE Air came in a 2023 earnings call with GlobalX founder and then-CEO Ed Wegel, when he discussed the company’s work for federal agencies like ICE. GlobalX employees “essentially don’t do much on the airplane,” Wegel said. “Our flight attendants are there in case of an emergency. The passengers are monitored by guards that are placed on board the airplane by one of those agencies.”\n\nFielding a question about how GlobalX ensures passengers are treated humanely, Wegel continued: “There have been threats made to our crew members, and they’re especially trained to deal with those. But we haven’t seen any mistreatment at all.”\n\nFlight attendants said they had little to do but sit in their jumpseats after delivering the preflight safety briefing in English to the mostly Spanish-speaking passengers. Above 10,000 feet, the two in the rear usually moved to passenger rows near the cockpit, then sat again. Some did crosswords. Others took photos out the window. On a deportation to Guatemala, one saw his first erupting volcano.\n\nLala had been scared before her first deportation flight, worried that violence might break out. But fear soon gave way to discomfort at how detainees were treated. “Not being able to serve them, not being able to look at them, I didn’t think that was right,” she said.\n\nSome flight attendants, drawn to the profession because they liked taking care of people, couldn’t help but break protocol with passengers. “If they said ‘hola’ or something,” one said, “I’d say ‘hola’ back. We’re not jerks.”\n\nAnother recalled taking a planeload of children and their escorts on a domestic transfer from the southern border to an airport in New York. He tried to slip snacks to the kids. “Even the chaperones were like, ‘Don’t give them any food,’” he said. “And I’m like, ‘Where is your humanity?’” (A second flight attendant said that children on a New York flight were fed by their escorts.)\n\nWhile flight attendants were allowed to interact with the guards, the dynamic was uncomfortable. It came down to a question of who was in charge — and which agency, ICE or the FAA, ultimately held sway. (The FAA declined to comment on this story and directed questions to ICE.)\n\nThe guards often asked flight attendants to heat up the food they brought from home. They asked for drinks, for ice. “They treated us like we were their maids,” said Akilah Sisk, a former flight attendant from Texas.\n\n“In their eyes, the detainees are not the passengers,” another flight attendant said. “The passengers are the guards. And we’re there for the guards.”\n\nSome guards thumbed their noses at the FAA safety rules that flight attendants were supposed to enforce while airborne, multiple flight attendants recalled. “One reported me because I asked him to sit down in the last 10 minutes,” Sisk said. “But you’re still on a freaking plane. You gotta listen to our words.”\n\nFlight attendants said that if they told guards to fasten seatbelts during takeoff or stow carry-ons under a seat, they risked getting reported to their bosses at GlobalX, who they said wanted to keep ICE happy. The guards would complain to the in-flight supervisor, Sisk said, and eventually it would get back to the flight attendant.\n\n“We’d get an email from somebody in management: ‘Why are you guys causing problems?’” another flight attendant recalled. “They were more worried about losing the contract than about anything else.”\n\nNothing bothered flight attendants more than the fact that most of their passengers were in chains. What would happen if a flight had to be evacuated?\n\nMost of the migrants crowding the back seats of ICE Air’s planes have not been, historically, convicted criminals. ICE makes restraints mandatory nonetheless. “Detainees transported by ICE Air aircraft will be fully restrained by the use of handcuffs, waist chains, and leg irons,“ reads an unredacted version of the 2015 ICE Air Operations Handbook, which was obtained by the Center for Constitutional Rights, a legal advocacy group.\n\nThe handbook allows for other equipment “in special circumstances, i.e., spit masks, mittens, leg braces, cargo straps, humane restraint blanket, etc.” Multiple lawsuits on behalf of African asylum-seekers concern the use of one such item, known as the Wrap, a cross between a straitjacket and a sleeping bag. A flight attendant said detainees restrained in the device are strapped upright in their seats or, if less compliant, lengthwise across a row of seats. Getting “burritoed, I call it,” the person said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties investigated the asylum-seekers’ complaints and found ICE lacked “sufficient policies” on the Wrap, but how the immigration agency addressed the finding is not publicly known. ICE responded to one lawsuit by saying detainees were not abused; it said another should be dismissed, in part because it was filed in the wrong place. The cases are pending.\n\nUse of the Wrap continues. A video from Seattle’s Boeing Field taken in February shows officers and guards carrying a wrapped migrant into the cabin of a deportation plane.\n\nA choppy video feed shows ICE officers and guards carrying a migrant in a full-body restraint into a GlobalX deportation plane at Seattle’s Boeing Field in February. Credit: Obtained by ProPublica via a public records request\n\nNeither the ICE Air handbook, nor FAA regulations, nor flight attendant training in Miami explained how to empty a plane full of people whose movements were, by design, so severely hampered. Shackled detainees didn’t even qualify as “able-bodied” enough to sit in exit rows.\n\nTo flight attendants, the restraints seemed at odds with the FAA’s “90-second rule,” a decades-old manufacturing standard that says an aircraft must be built for full evacuation in 90 seconds even with half the exits blocked.\n\nLala and others said no one told them how to evacuate passengers in chains. “Honestly, I don’t know what we would do,” she said.\n\nThe flight attendants are not alone in voicing concerns.\n\nIn an interview with ProPublica, Bobby Laurie, an airline safety expert and former flight attendant, called the arrangement on ICE Air flights “disturbing.”\n\n“Part of flight attendant training is locating those passengers who can help you in an evacuation,” Laurie told ProPublica. That would have to be the guards. “But if they have to help you,” who is helping the detainees, Laurie wondered.\n\nAccording to formal ICE Air incident reports reviewed by Capital & Main, the deportation network had at least six accidents requiring evacuations between 2014 and 2019. In at least two cases, both on a carrier called World Atlantic, the evacuations were led not by flight attendants but by untrained guards. Both took longer than 90 seconds, though not by much: two-and-a-half minutes for the first, “less than 2 minutes” for the next. But in a third case, it took seven minutes for 115 shackled detainees to escape a smoke-filled jet.\n\nIn one of the World Atlantic incidents, part of the landing gear broke, a wing caught fire and the smell of burning rubber seeped in, according to investigative records obtained by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights. In an email to ICE Air officials, an agency employee aboard the plane later wrote that flight attendants made no emergency announcements for passengers. The flight attendants simply got themselves out.\n\nThe ICE officer, guards and nurse were “confused on what to do and in which direction to exit during distress,” the officer wrote. He said that other than the flight crew, “no one has received any training on emergency evacuation situations.”\n\nThe University of Washington’s collection does not include findings or recommendations from ICE based on what happened, and ICE did not say what they were when asked by ProPublica. The National Transportation Safety Board said that after the accident, World Atlantic launched a campaign to reinspect landing gear, gave employees and contractors further training, and revised its procedures for inspections. The airline did not respond to questions from ProPublica.\n\n \nAn ICE Air flight was evacuated in Alexandria, Louisiana, in April 2018 after a piece of the landing gear failed upon touchdown. All detainees were helped off the plane by guards, according to emails to ICE officials from an agency employee who was on board. Credit: Courtesy of the University of Washington Center for Human Rights\n\nOther reports obtained by the University of Washington mention fuel spills, loss of cabin air pressure and a “large altercation” on ICE Air after 2019 but no more evacuations, at least as of June 2022. More recent incidents that have been mentioned in the press include an engine fire last summer on World Atlantic and a failed GlobalX air conditioning unit that sent 11 detainees to the hospital with “heat-related injuries.”\n\nThe rare guidance some flight attendants said they received on carrying out ICE Air evacuations came during briefings from pilots. What they heard, they said, was chilling and went against their training.\n\n“Just get up and leave,” one recalled a GlobalX pilot telling him. “That’s it. … Save your life first.”\n\nHe understood the instructions to mean that evacuating detainees was not a priority, or even the flight attendants’ responsibility. The detainees were in other people’s hands, or in no one’s.\n\nWhen asked if they got similar guidance from pilots, three flight attendants said they did not, and one did not answer. Two more, like the first, said pilots gave them instructions that they took to mean they shouldn’t help detainees after opening the exit doors.\n\n“That was the normal briefing,” said a flight attendant from Lala’s class. “‘If a fire occurs in the cabin, if we land on water, don’t check on the immigrants. Just make sure that you and the guards and the people that work for the government get off.’”\n\n“It was as if the detainees’ lives were worthless,” said the other.\n\nThe day the girl collapsed on Lala’s flight, the pilot turned the plane around and they crossed back into the United States.\n\nThe flight landed in Arizona. Paramedics rushed on board and connected the girl to their own oxygen bottle. They began shuttling her off the plane. Her parents tried to join. But the guards stopped the father.\n\nShocked, Lala approached the ICE officer in charge. “This is not OK!” she yelled. The mom had seizures. The family needed to stay together.\n\nBut the officer said it was impossible. Only one parent could go to the hospital. The other, as Lala understood it, “was going to get deported.”\n\nRead More\n\nTrump Is Sending Migrants From Around the World to Guantanamo. One Mother Speaks Out About Her Son’s Detention.\n\nMost of the flight attendants who spoke with ProPublica are now gone from GlobalX. Some left because they found other jobs. Some left even though they hadn’t. Some left because the charter company, as it focused more and more on deportations, shut down the hub in their city.\n\nLala eventually left because of the little girl and her family, because she couldn’t do the deportation flights anymore. Her GlobalX uniform hung in her closet for a time, a reminder of her career as a flight attendant. Recently, she said, she threw it away.\n\nShe never learned whether the little girl lived or died. Lala just watched her mom follow her off the plane, then watched the dad return to his seat.\n\n“I cried after that,” she said. She bought her own ticket home.\n\nFiled under —\n\nImmigration\nMcKenzie Funk\n\nI cover immigration, privacy and climate change from my native Pacific Northwest.\n\nMore Stories\nNeed to Get in Touch?\n\nI'm eager to hear from anyone connected to the business of immigration enforcement: technologists, data brokers, activists, airplane pilots, private-prison officials and insiders at ICE, CBP and DHS writ large.",

    "content": "Digital assets have grown into a multi-trillion-dollar market, yet they remain largely disconnected from traditional finance. Institutional investors increasingly want to own and monetize digital assets, but most banks, broker-dealers and asset managers operate on infrastructure designed for stocks and bonds — not blockchain-based assets. While spot crypto ETFs are an important step toward integration, they only enable passive exposure to the asset class. For digital assets to fully mature, they need a mechanism that bridges them with the entirety of the existing capital markets infrastructure in a familiar, regulated way.You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.Enter American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). For nearly a century, receipts have served as that bridge for international stocks, debt and commodities, enabling U.S. investors to own foreign assets with the same ease as domestic securities. The first ADR—issued in 1927—set the stage for a system that today facilitates trillions in global investment. ADRs work because they provide fungibility, economic and governance rights and U.S. regulatory oversight, all while ensuring efficient settlement through the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC). They enhance local liquidity and market access, as seen in Chinese companies listing on the London Stock Exchange and U.S. stocks trading in Brazil.Crypto as the modern foreign marketCrypto-focused ADRs will play a similar role for digital assets. Just like foreign markets, crypto operates outside the traditional U.S. capital markets, making it difficult for most institutions to engage without specialized infrastructure. ADRs provide a regulated, accessible and familiar framework that enables:Seamless access – Crypto can be included in funds and held at existing banks and brokerage accounts, unlocking traditional capital markets utility.Efficient two-way convertibility – By not being limited to authorized intermediaries, ADRs provide asset owners the choice to convert underlying crypto and ADRs in-kind.Cost efficiency – ADR conversions are simple, same-day processes that do not require a NAV calculation. Fees are never deducted by selling the underlying crypto.Institutional workflow compatibility – Settlement through DTCC via unique identifiers like CUSIP and ISIN ensure seamless alignment with existing workflows.TradFi demands cryptoInstitutional demand for digital assets is surging, but most traditional market participants are still tied to DTCC rails and are not set up to directly interact with crypto. ADRs meet these firms where they are today, while also addressing key regulatory, compliance and operational hurdles:Regulation – ADRs are SEC-regulated securities with CUSIPs, ISINs and tickers, ensuring investor protection.Compliance – Only regulated entities (broker-dealers, banks, etc.) custody and service ADRs, maintaining high compliance standards.Operations – ADRs settle through traditional stock clearing systems, just like any other security.Unlocking market expansionBy linking the $3 trillion crypto market with the $87 trillion securities market in DTCC, ADRs can drive institutional adoption and unlock new opportunities in the traditional markets, including the following:24/7 trading – Crypto markets never close, but traditional securities do. ADRs enable round-the-clock trading of traditional securities, mitigating overnight and weekend risk. Since the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, BTC has experienced 10% swings on two separate weekends —moves that institutional investors could not fully capitalize on.Yield, lending & settlement – ADRs could be used for margin trading, settlement of spot crypto and futures trading, collateralized lending and structured products. Due to their unique ability to link ADR and spot crypto liquidity, ADRs are an ideal instrument to institutionalize these use cases.Custody choice – Investors can conveniently hold assets on-chain or in traditional brokerage accounts.Fund inclusion – Due to their security status, ADRs enable crypto ownership in ETFs and institutional portfolios.Conclusion: a foundation for institutional growthADRs revolutionized global investing by making foreign stocks seamlessly available to U.S. investors. Now, there is a unique opportunity to continue this legacy of enabling market access. By providing a regulated, efficient and familiar bridge for institutions to engage with digital assets, ADRs could be the key to unlocking crypto’s next stage of growth and ultimately bring new institutional capital on-chain.",

    "title": "5 Crypto Tax Mistakes That Could Trigger an IRS Audit",
    "content": "With IRS audits on the rise for 2025, cryptocurrency holders face more scrutiny than ever. It’s not just about paying taxes. The evolving rules mean even small oversights can lead to large penalties or expensive audits. You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.Below are five common missteps that often catch crypto investors off guard — and how you can stay compliant.Neglecting wallet-based accounting: The IRS now expects detailed reporting of each wallet’s transactions and balances. That means no more lumping all your trades together on a single spreadsheet. Whether you’re using hot wallets, cold wallets or a combination of both, each wallet’s records must be individually tracked. Tools like CoinTracking, CoinLedger or TaxBit can simplify this process by syncing real-time data from various exchanges. Proper wallet-based accounting not only keeps you compliant but also prevents surprises if the IRS decides to dig into your transaction history.Misreporting staking rewards: Staking rewards are taxable income the moment they hit your wallet — even if you haven’t sold them for fiat. Many people mistakenly think they only have to report staking income at the time of sale, but the IRS disagrees. For instance, if you earn 2 ETH worth $3,000 total in staking rewards, that’s taxable income when received. Missing or misstating these amounts can draw unwanted attention from regulators who are already watching crypto activity closely.Overlooking IRS letters and form 1099-DA: Key IRS notices like Notice 6371 (basically, “we have questions”), Notice 6374 (“explain yourself”) and CP2000 (“we think you owe us”) can arrive if something doesn’t line up in your tax filings. In 2025, crypto exchanges will also send Form 1099-DA, which outlines your crypto income, trades and rewards. Any discrepancy between this form and what you report is a surefire red flag. Always review these documents carefully for accuracy and be prepared to correct any errors before they escalate.Failing to report all transactions: Think those small trades on a decentralized exchange are invisible? Think again. The IRS and its partners have sophisticated blockchain analysis tools that track activity, even on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and privacy coins. Every single transaction — trades, airdrops, forks and rewards — must be included in your tax filing. “I forgot” won’t save you if your wallet addresses are linked to unreported transactions.Missing the chance to adjust cost basis and avoiding excessive deductions: The 2025 tax year brings a critical opportunity to adjust your crypto cost basis under new guidelines. These rules allow investors to reallocate unused cost basis across wallets or exchange accounts, provided they document the method before their first 2025 trade and follow specific record keeping requirements. Done correctly, it can lower your capital gains tax and keep you in the clear. However, going too far with deductions — like inflating business expenses or hobby-related costs — can trigger an audit if numbers appear unrealistic. The IRS scrutinizes deductions that don’t align with typical income levels, so stay within reason and maintain thorough supporting records.Staying audit-readyCrypto taxation is increasingly complex, but staying compliant doesn’t have to be stressful. The best practices? Use reliable crypto tax software, double-check every detail on your return, keep meticulous records and be transparent if you discover past errors. A proactive approach helps ensure you’re ready for any IRS inquiry — and keeps your focus on what really matters: your crypto investments.Please see here for the full article and more detailed guidance.",

    "content": "The crypto industry's primary political action committee, Fairshake, flooded support to Republican candidates in the U.S. House of Representatives special elections this week in Florida that aimed to fill vacant seats in Congress. Both candidates won, further reinforcing the party's narrow national majority.The two seats in Florida had been vacated when President Donald Trump tapped the previous members to join his administration, including his national security advisor, Michael Waltz, and the congressman Trump initially picked as attorney general, Matt Gaetz, who quickly bowed out under the pressure of accusations that he'd had sex with a minor and was linked to illegal drug use.Florida voters elected state Senator Randy Fine to take Waltz's former seat and picked the state's chief financial officer, Jimmy Patronis, to replace Gaetz. The races drew a high level of attention and money from both parties, because of every seat's importance to the tight majority in the House. While Democrats failed to steer the conservative districts onto their side, they did win much more support in both districts than they had in the recent 2024 elections.An affiliate of the Fairshake PAC had paid for advertising supporting the pro-crypto candidates, Patronis and Fine, in the primary and general elections in Florida, including a last-minute $1.5 million to help ensure their victory.\"We are thrilled to see two strong champions of innovation headed to Washington,\" said Fairshake spokesman Josh Vlasto, in a statement. \"Both leaders have shown a deep commitment to advancing pro-growth policies and ensuring the United States leads the world in crypto and digital assets innovation.\"The arrival of both in the House leaves just two vacancies there because of deaths of Democrat members from Texas and Arizona.",

    "title": "Bitcoin ETFs Could See $3B in Q2 Inflows Even Without Price Recovery, Says Analyst",
    "content": "The spot bitcoin ETFs saw sizable inflows in the first quarter despite the lame price action and at least one analyst sees the next three months as even bigger even if the prices don't recover.“Even if current market conditions persist in the second quarter, we are seeing strong traction from financial advisors and institutional investors,\" said Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at Bitwise (whose BITB is among the bitcoin ETFs).\"While retail interest is weak due to the fixation on price action, professional investors are recognizing the global adoption momentum spurred by the Trump administration’s embrace of bitcoin, and many are seeing these market conditions as an opportunity to start or increase an allocation,\" Leon added.The ETFs saw over $1 billion in inflows in the first quarter of the year despite a challenging macro situation that sent the S&P 500 Index into its biggest quarterly loss since 2022 and bitcoin's 13% plunge.Leon expects inflows to be even stronger in the second quarter — as much as $3 billion or even more as wirehouse platforms unlock and legislative policy progresses.ETF inflows possibly less than meets the eyeThe $1 billion in first quarter net flows — and whatever the second quarter brings — doesn't necessarily reflect investor interest in buying the bitcoin dip. That's because of the so-called basis trade (also known as cash-and-carry). In this, institutional players buy the spot bitcoin ETF while shorting CME bitcoin futures, picking up yield without exposure to price movement.That yield was well into the double-digits in late 2024 and remained nicely above the risk-free rate throughout much of the first quarter. It's collapsed to the 5% area of late, suggesting arbitrage-related ETF inflows may dry up.Back to bull case: It's still early“While a favorable price environment would certainly be a boost, it's important to remember that adoption of spot bitcoin ETFs by these groups is still in its infancy,\" said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, who is also bullish on the outlook for inflows throughout the rest of the year.. \"As they grow more comfortable allocating to bitcoin, this should provide a meaningful tailwind for inflows,” he added..,While many institutions have indeed already made their first allocations into bitcoin in the past year, it represents only a small fraction of ETF investment, with most of the money still coming from retail investors — something recently noted by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, whose IBIT is the asset-gathering leader among the spot ETFs. The more favorable regulatory stance toward the industry, not to mention the government’s own potential allocation into bitcoin, however, means that ratio could soon shift significantly.During an ETF conference in Las Vegas earlier this month, a survey showed that 57% of advisors plan on increasing their allocations into crypto ETFs this year as crypto has lost its “reputational risk” attribute among advisors.The view that bitcoin could serve as a “safe haven” in times of an economic decline, which investors remain anxious about, could also boost confidence in the asset, especially as fears of a potential recession grow.“If we see continued rate cut expectations, signs of economic uncertainty, or deepening fears of a potential recession in the US, Bitcoin’s role as 'digital gold' will likely support additional inflows,” said David Siemer, CEO of Wave Digital Assets. “While some short-term traders may rotate out if price weakness persists, long-term players will continue to keep inflows strong, especially as institutional adoption takes off and drives demand throughout the year.\"",

    "title": "Why a Diversified Approach to Crypto Investing Makes Sense",
    "content": "Once considered speculative investments, cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly mainstream. In Europe, WisdomTree is at the forefront of leading that charge. The global financial services firm offers a number of exchange-traded products (ETPs) that offer diversification and an incredibly easy way to buy and sell crypto assets.Here Dovile Silenskyte, WisdomTree’s Director of Digital Assets Research, discusses crypto’s evolution as an asset class, the most recent adoption trends and WisdomTree’s latest ETP based on the CoinDesk 20 index.How do you see crypto becoming more akin to a traditional asset class?As with every asset class, diversification is essential. Investors diversify across and within equity and bond positions, so it should be no different when considering allocating capital to cryptocurrencies. Relying solely on bitcoin is akin to holding only one stock in an equity portfolio, which is a suboptimal strategy in terms of risk-adjusted returns. A well-diversified approach across multiple digital assets can enhance exposure to the broader growth of the sector.As the digital asset class evolves, investors require a benchmark to measure performance, invest and trade. The CoinDesk 20 index serves as the benchmark index for the crypto industry and is the world’s most traded crypto index — it could be viewed as the S&P 500 of crypto. Taking a broad and diversified approach through the CoinDesk 20 provides a practical way to access opportunities across the digital asset market.For investors who lack access to deep crypto knowledge, broad-based crypto indices offer a streamlined way to gain market exposure without the complexities of token selection. Just as ETF investors use index-based funds to gain equity exposure without stock-picking, a diversified crypto index allows for systematic, passive participation in the growth of digital assets.What kind of adoption trends have you seen in the past? Are there geographical nuances you’ve observed?After more than 15 years of existence, multiple boom-and-bust cycles and over half a billion users, cryptocurrencies have cemented their place as a major asset class rather than a passing trend. Bitcoin and ether have become integral components of institutional portfolios.Despite cryptocurrencies' long-term growth potential, many investors are still unsure. With a total market cap of approximately $3 trillion, the ecosystem and use cases are growing steadily. The crypto market is now of a similar (or larger) size as staple institutional investments such as high-yield bonds, inflation-linked bonds and emerging markets small caps.Crypto adoption is not monolithic — it varies across geographies based on regulatory landscapes, institutional infrastructure and economic needs. Europe is leading the way with investors being able to invest into bitcoin exchange-traded products for the last 5+ years and now having access to a broad range of single coin and crypto basket ETPs.How is WisdomTree enabling this next phase of growth beyond bitcoin?WisdomTree has been providing access to crypto via ETPs since 2019. It has since grown its range to include ETPs providing exposure to five other individual coins and four diversified basket products, including its new ETP providing exposure to the CoinDesk 20. WisdomTree's crypto ETPs leverage institutional-grade storage solutions ensuring high levels of security, and some of them also generate a staking yield. By incorporating staking into a crypto ETP, investors can gain exposure to the growth of these networks while also participating in their security and governance.Tell us more about the WisdomTree Physical CoinDesk 20 ETP that you just launched.The strategy helps investors avoid the complexities of selecting individual assets, as it aims to provide secure and diversified exposure to approximately 90% of the crypto market by market cap, helping shape the next wave of innovation. The strategy also provides a highly diversified entry point into the crypto ecosystem, further democratizing access to a historically difficult part of the market to get exposure to. And finally, the strategy also aims to provide staking yield.Where can someone get additional information?European investors can access more information about WisdomTree’s physically-backed crypto ETP range here.Disclosure: This material is prepared by WisdomTree and its affiliates and is not intended to be relied upon as a forecast, research or investment advice, and is not a recommendation, offer or solicitation to buy or sell any securities or to adopt any investment strategy.

Solana's top DeFi exchange just brought digital collectibles platform DRiP Haus into its orbit.The acquisition is part of Jupiter's push to become what Jupiter's Kash Dhanda calls the \"Solana super app:\" a home not only for traders of financial instruments like swaps and perps, but for digital culture connoisseurs too.\"We don't believe it,\" Dhanda said of the NFT doomsayers. \"We think NFTs are here for the long term.\"Built from the bricks of the short-lived Solana store, DRiP Haus survived the NFT market's brutal downturn as a digital collectibles distribution hub. Instead of trading it focuses on disseminating: Startups across Solanaland spin up and send out their visual campaigns on DRiP, according to Dhanda, who estimates it now creates the vast majority of Solana NFTs that \"aren't spam.\"Dhanda and DRiP Labs founder Vibhu Norby both declined to state how much Jupiter paid in the all-cash deal. A person familiar with the deal estimated it at two times the funds raised. The startup previously raised $11.5 million from venture investors.Jupiter co-founder Meow hinted at the acquisition in late February during his campaign to defer a multi-million dollar token payday, which yields more JUP for him later while funding token incentive programs for acqui-hired teams now. Norby confirmed his team will be getting tokens from the incentives program.Half of DRiP's eight-person team will continue working on the distribution platform, while the other half will focus on bolstering Jupiter's currently nonexistent NFT capabilities, most critically by adding a swaps router to the DeFi exchange's homepage.Norby will oversee DRiP from an \"executive, strategic point of view\" from within Jupiter. While the DRiP brand will remain separate, Norby said its visual identity will be reworked to align more closely with the new mothership. He's also working on building a \"really, really excellent NFT experience\" within Jupiter's mobile app.",

    "content": "Avalanche's AVAX token is poised for major gains in coming years that should outpace already bullish outlooks for both bitcoin and ether, according to Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick.“The unique thing about Avalanche is how it is attempting to achieve scale. Unlike Ethereum or Solana, Avalanche (AVAX) uses a set of subnets, or sidechains,” Kendrick said in a note on Wednesday, initiating coverage on AVAX with a $55 price target for the end of 2025, $100 for 2026, $150 for 2027, $200 for 2028 and $250 by the completion of 2029.“While it is still too early to tell whether the new subnet approach will work, we think the fact that one-quarter of active subnets are already Etna-compatible is encouraging.”He also pointed out the network’s growing developer number since its upgrade in December, which cut the cost of establishing a subnet close to zero.Avalanche, which stands at a $9 billion market cap, is currently the 15th-largest cryptocurrency by that metric, making it a great candidate to profit from a big impact even through incremental improvements, according to Kendrick. Among blockchains, it is the tenth-largest by total value locked (TVL).“As a result, we see AVAX outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of relative price gains in the coming years, reaching a level around USD 250 by end-2029, more than 10x today’s price.”Ahead of the December upgrade, the Avalanche Foundation, the issuer of AVAX, raised $250 million in a token sale, led by Galaxy Digital, Dragonfly and ParaFi Capital.",

    "content": "FDUSD, the stablecoin issued by Hong Kong-based First Digital, has wobbled from its $1 price peg as investor concerns mounted over its reserves, though the company said Wednesday that it was \"completely solvent.\"FDUSD has dropped to 0.87 against Tether's USDT stablecoin and 0.76 against Circle's USDC on Binance, the main exchange where FDUSD is listed. Notably, bitcoin (BTC) also nearly hit 100,000 against FDUSD. The token has stabilized around $0.98-$0.96 later, still trading below its supposed price anchor.The sudden price action happened as CoinDesk earlier Wednesday reported that some of the TrueUSD stablecoin's reserve assets were stuck in illiquid investments, according to filings. Tron founder Justin Sun bailed out the issuer company. First Digital Trust, a trust company affiliated to First Digital, was appointed to manage TUSD reserves. \"First Digital Trust (FDT) is effectively insolvent and unable to fulfill client fund redemptions. I strongly recommend that users take immediate action to secure their assets,\" Tron founder Justin Sun claimed in a Wednesday X post. First Digital refuted the allegations in an X post, saying that \"First Digital is completely solvent\" and \"every dollar backing FDUSD is completely, secure, safe and accounted for with US backed T-Bills.\"\"This is a typical Justin Sun smear campaign to try to attack a competitor to his business. As we told the reporter at CoinDesk, we have not yet had the opportunity to defend ourselves and instead of letting the TUSD matter be dealt with in court, Justin has instead resorted to a coordinated social media effort to try to damage FDUSD as a business competitor,\" the company said. \"FDT will pursue legal action to protect its rights and reputation.\" FDUSD's latest monthly reserve report showed that the $2 billion of reserve assets were held mostly in U.S. Treasury bills and a lesser part in repo facilities and fixed deposits. Stablecoin analytics firm Bluechip told CoinDesk it gave FDUSD a C grade (on a scale from F as least safe to to A+ being safest) and expressed concerns over reserve assets being bankruptcy remote from the issuer company. \"FDUSD appears to be backed by reasonably sound reserves. But we concluded that in case of bankruptcy, the reserves could be used to pay off the parent company’s debt,\" Garett Jones, Bluechip's chief economist, said in a message. \"It’s hard to predict what would really happen in a crisis, but safer stablecoins do exist.\"UPDATE (Apr. 2, 17:58): Added analyst comment from Bluechip.

    "title": "Ben Fielding: Decentralizing Machine Intelligence",
    "content": "It started with a noisy desk. The desk was a wooden cubicle in a lab at Northumbria University, in northern England, where a young AI researcher began his PhD track. This was in 2015. The researcher was Ben Fielding, who had built a large machine stuffed with early GPUs to develop AI. The machine was so loud it annoyed Fielding’s lab-mates. Fielding crammed the machine beneath the desk, but it was so big he had to awkwardly stick his legs to the side.Fielding had some unorthodox ideas. He explored how “swarms” of AI — clusters of many different models — could talk to each other and learn from each other, which might improve the collective whole. There was just one problem: He was handcuffed by the realities of that noisy machine beneath his desk. And he knew he was outgunned. “Google was doing this research as well,” Fielding says now. “And they had thousands [of GPUs] in a data center. The things they were doing weren’t crazy. I knew the methods... I had lots of proposals, but I couldn’t run them.”Ben Fielding, CEO of Gensyn, is a speaker at Consensus 2025 in Toronto.Jeff Wilser is the host of The People’s AI: The Decentralized AI Podcast and will host The AI Summit at Consensus 2025.So a decade ago, it dawned on Fielding: Compute constraints would always be an issue. In 2015, he knew that if compute was a hard constraint in academia, it would absolutely be a hard constraint when AI went mainstream.The solution?Decentralized AI.Fielding co-founded Gensyn (along with Harry Grieve) in 2020, or years before Decentralized AI became fashionable. The project was initially known for building decentralized compute – and I’ve spoken with Fielding about this for CoinDesk and on panel after panel at conferences – but the vision is actually something wider: “The network for machine intelligence.” They’re building solutions up and down the tech stack.And now, a decade after Fielding’s noisy desk annoyed his lab-mates, the early tools of Gensyn are out in the wild. Gensyn recently released its “RL Swarms” protocol (a descendant of Fielding’s PhD work) and just launched its Testnet — which brings blockchain into the fold.In this conversation leading up to the AI Summit, at Consensus in Toronto, Fielding gives a primer on AI Swarms, explains how blockchain snaps into the puzzle, and shares why all innovators -- not just tech giants — “should have the right to build machine learning technologies.”This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.Congrats on the testnet launch. What’s the gist of what it is?Ben Fielding: It’s the addition of the first MVP features of blockchain integration with what we've launched so far.What were those original features, pre-blockchain?So we launched RL [Reinforcement Learning] Swarm a few weeks ago, which is reinforcement learning, post-training, as a peer-to-peer network.Here’s the easiest way to think about it. When a pre-trained model goes through reasoning training – like DeepSeek-R1 – it learns to critique its own thinking and recursively improve against the task. It can then improve its own answer.We take that process one step further and say, “It’s great for models to critique their own thinking and recursively improve. What if they can talk to other models and critique each other's thinking?” If you get many models together in a group that can all talk to each other, they can start learning how to send information to the other models… with the overall goal of improving the entire swarm itself.Gotcha, which explains the name “Swarm.”Right. It’s this training method which allows many models to kind of combine, in parallel, to improve the outcome of a final meta-model that you could create from those models. But at the same time, you have every single individual model just improving on its own. So if you were to come along with a model on a MacBook, join a swarm for an hour and then drop back out again, you would have an improved local model based on the knowledge in the swarm, and you would have also improved the other models in the swarm. It’s this collaborative training process that any model can join and any model can do. So that's what RL Swarm is.Okay, so that’s what you released a few weeks ago. Now where does blockchain come in?So the blockchain is us moving forward some of the lower-level primitives into the system.Let’s just pretend that someone doesn’t understand the phrase “lower-level primitives.” What do you mean by that?Yeah, so I mean, very close to the resource itself. So if you think about the software stack, you've got a GPU stack in a data center. You've got drivers on top of the GPU. You've got operating systems, virtual machines. You've got all this stuff going up.So a lower-level primitive is the closest to the bottom foundation in the tech stack. Am I getting that right?Yes, exactly. And the RL Swarm is a demonstration of what's possible, basically. It's just a somewhat hacky demo of doing really interesting large-scale, scalable machine learning. But what Gensyn's been doing for the past four-plus years, realistically, is building infrastructure. And so we're in this period now where the infrastructure is all at that v0.1 sort of beta level. It's all done. It's ready to go. We have to figure out how to show the world what's possible when it's quite a big shift to the way people think of machine learning.It sounds like you guys are doing a lot more than decentralized compute, or even infrastructure?We have three main components that sit underneath our infrastructure. Execution – we have consistent execution libraries. We have our own compiler. We have reproducible libraries for any hardware target.The second piece is communication. So assume you can just run a model on any device in the world that's compatible, can you get them to talk to each other? If everybody opts into the same standard, everybody can communicate like TCP/IP from the internet, basically. So we build those libraries and RL Swarm is an example of that communication.And then, finally, verification.Ah, and I’m guessing this is where blockchain comes in…Imagine a scenario where every device in the world is executing consistently. They could link models together. But can they trust each other? If I connected my MacBook to yours, yes, they could execute the same tasks. Yes, they could send tensors back and forth, but do they know that what they send to the other device is actually happening on the other device or not?In the current world, you and I would probably sign a contract to say, yes, we agree that we'll make sure our devices do the right thing. In the machine world, it needs to happen programmatically. So that's the final piece we build, cryptographic proofs, probabilistic proofs, game theoretic proofs to make that process entirely programmatic.So that's where the blockchain comes in. It gives us all of the benefits of blockchain you can imagine, like persistent identity, payments, consensus, etc. And so what we're doing with the testnet now is taking RL Swarm and the primitives of the other infrastructure and we're adding in the blockchain components and saying, ‘Hey, when you join a swarm now, you have a persistent identity, which exists out there on a decentralized ledger.’In the future you’ll have the ability to make payments, but right now, you have that trust consensus mechanism where we can terminate disputes. So, it's kind of an MVP of the future Gensyn infrastructure, where we’re going to add in components as we go.Give us a tease of what’s coming down the pipeline?When we reach main-net, all of the software and infrastructure is live against blockchain as the source of trust, payments, consensus, etc., identity. This is the first step of that. It's adding identity in and saying when you join a swarm, you can register as the same person. Everyone knows who you are without having to check some centralized server or website somewhere.Now let’s get wild and talk further in the future. What does this look like one year from now, two years from now, five years from now? What’s your North Star?Sure. The ultimate vision is to take all of the resources that sit under machine learning and make them instantaneously programmatically accessible to everyone. Machine learning is heavily constrained by its core resources. This creates this huge moat for centralized AI companies, but it doesn't need to exist. It can be open-sourced if we can build the right software. So our view is Gensyn builds all of the low-level infrastructure to allow that to get as close to open-source as it possibly can. People should have the right to build machine learning technologies.",

    "content": "The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world’s largest securities settlement system, is pushing deeper into crypto with introducing a blockchain-based platform for tokenized collateral management.Collateral is a fundamental part of risk management in financial markets, ensuring stability amid market fluctuations. However, traditional systems often suffer from inefficiencies due to fragmented infrastructure and lagging settlements.DTCC said its new platform seeks to address these challenges by tokenizing collateral on blockchain rails, allowing for real-time transfers and automation through smart contracts, according to a Wednesday press release. The platform runs within DTCC’s AppChain ecosystem, which was developed on top of LF Decentralized Trust’s Besu blockchain.Read more: Why Asset Tokenization Is Inevitable\"Collateral mobility is the ‘killer app’ for institutional use of blockchain,\" Dan Doney, chief technology officer of DTCC Digital Assets, said in a statement. \"By using smart contracts to automate the full range of collateral operations, we enable complex trade execution across markets in real-time at any time, even in volatile conditions.\"\"This platform is unique in that we’ve created something that’s more open, flexible, dynamic, and comprehensive than any previous digital collateral initiative,\" said Nadine Chakar, global head of DTCC Digital Assets.The initiative comes as tokenization of traditional financial instruments such as bonds, funds and other traditional investments has become one of the hottest use cases for blockchain technology. Multiple financial heavyweights like BlackRock, CME Group and Fidelity have thrown their hat in the ring pursuing benefits such as operational efficiencies, speedier settlements and increased transparency compared to using traditional financial plumbing.DTCC will showcase the platform’s capabilities at the \"The Great Collateral Experiment\" event on April 23, where industry participants will test how tokenized assets can be mobilized across markets. The company said it also plans to engage with regulators and industry leaders to establish global standards for tokenized collateral.",

I'm Ben Schiller.In this issue:Vana launches token standardHashgraph to debut private blockchainASICs will look more like serversAn interview with Gensyn’s Ben FieldingThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.Network NewsVANA’S DATA-BACKED TOKEN STANDARD: Crypto enthusiasts might have heard of the ERC-20 token standard, which provides guidelines to ensure that tokens created on the Ethereum smart contract blockchain are compatible and can interact with other tokens and applications within the network. A similar standard for data-backed tokens, called VRC-20, has now emerged. Vana, an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain that helps users monetize personal data by bundling it into DataDAOs for AI model training, introduced the new standard early this week to boost trust and transparency in the market for data-backed digital assets. The VRC-20 standard design includes specific criteria such as fixed supply, governance, and liquidity rules while ensuring real data access by tying tokens to actual data utility. Additionally, it promotes continuous liquidity through rewards that ensure market stability. \"This isn’t speculation. This is real financialization of data,\" Vana noted on X. Vana launched its mainnet in December, with VANA as its native cryptocurrency. Since then, the network has onboarded over 12 million data points through multiple DataDAOs, reflecting strong demand for user-owned data. DataDAOs or data liquidity pools are decentralized marketplaces that bring data on-chain as transferable digital tokens. DLPs are where data is contributed, tokenized and made ready for use in applications such as AI model training. — Omkar Godbole Read more.HASHGRAPH LINES UP Q3 PRIVATE CHAIN: Hashgraph, the blockchain development firm focusing on the Hedera (HBAR) network, is building a private, permissioned blockchain for enterprises in highly regulated industries with plans to debut in the third quarter of 2025. HashSphere, built with Hedera's technology, aims to bridge private and public distributed ledgers, ensuring compliance with regulations while maintaining interoperability, the company said Monday. Hashgraph is looking to provide services to asset managers, banks and payment providers seeking secure, low-cost cross-border transactions with stablecoins.While public blockchains offer security and transparency, enterprises in industries like finance and payments often face compliance challenges, particularly with know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. HashSphere addresses this by restricting access to verified participants, enabling firms to develop tokenized assets, AI-powered services and other blockchain-based products while meeting regulatory standards. The network also integrates Hedera’s existing tools, including the Token Service for managing digital assets and the Consensus Service for recording transactions with trusted timestamps. The platform is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to deploy decentralized applications using Solidity and other EVM languages. — Kris Sandor Read more.ASICS TO BE MORE LIKE SERVERS: In the beginning, there were only CPUs, then GPUs, for bitcoin mining. Then came the mighty ASIC in 2013, and with it, the “shoebox” form factor that has become emblematic of the bitcoin mining industry. What comes next? ASIC manufacturers are increasingly betting on a hydro-cooled server rack design to become a substantial portion of bitcoin mining fleets, leaning into the “direct-to-chip” cooling for further efficiency gains. Last September, Bitmain announced its model U3S21EXPH developed in a partnership with Hut 8. Its U3 design means that one unit takes up three spaces in a traditional server rack. MicroBT soon followed with its M63 Hydro series, as did Bitdeer’s Sealminer A2 Hydro unit. Following suit, Auradine released its server rack model, the AH3880, this March. Its U2 design, which occupies two server slots, is a bit smaller, but it packs more hashrate per unit of space at 600 TH/s (or 300 TH/s per slot) versus Bitmain’s 860 TH/s (286.66 TH/s per slot). The benefit of a server rack ASIC lies in standardization. Bitcoin miners are increasingly marching in step with the traditional datacenter industry, and that industry could see 40% adoption of direct liquid-to-chip cooling by 2026, according to data center developer Cyrus One. If miners adopt this design, then theoretically, they can optimize their supply chains by converging on server designs that are becoming best practice in the big-boy data center sector. — Colin Harper, Blockspace Read more.GENSYN CEO BEN FIELDING: Ten years ago, when he was still a young AI researcher beginning his PhD track, Ben Fielding explored how “swarms” of AI — clusters of many different models — could talk to each other and learn from each other, which might improve the collective whole. There was just one problem: He was handcuffed by the realities of that noisy machine beneath his desk. And he knew he was outgunned by Google and other Big Tech. Compute constraints would always be an issue, he realized. The solution? Decentralized AI. Fielding co-founded Gensyn (along with Harry Grieve) in 2020, or years before Decentralized AI became fashionable. The project was initially known for building decentralized compute, but the vision is actually something wider: “The network for machine intelligence.” They’re building solutions up and down the tech stack. And now, a decade after Fielding’s noisy desk annoyed his lab-mates, the early tools of Gensyn are out in the wild. Gensyn recently released its “RL Swarms” protocol (a descendant of Fielding’s PhD work) and just launched its Testnet — which brings blockchain into the fold. Fielding talked with Jeff Wilser about AI Swarms, how blockchain snaps into the puzzle, and shares why all innovators — not just tech giants — “should have the right to build machine learning technologies.” — Jeff Wilser Read more.In Other NewsWeb3 lacks a dedicated memory layer, making its current architecture inefficient and difficult to scale.

    "title": "U.S. House Committee Advances Stablecoin Bill, While Dems Warn of Trump Conflicts",
    "content": "U.S. stablecoin legislation took another major step on Wednesday as a House of Representatives committee joined Senate counterparts in advancing a bill to be considered by the overall House, bringing stablecoin regulations closer to reality.Eventual approvals in both the overall House and Senate would let lawmakers start melding the two versions into a unified piece of legislation that could get a final nod. Republican lawmakers and President Donald Trump have aimed toward an August goal in getting the effort completed.Though the crypto industry and their most reliable Republican allies in Congress were happy to welcome many Democrats to the yes side on moving the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE Act) out of the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, the Democrats on the panel consistently raised concerns about Trump's connections to the industry and stablecoins. Still, six Democrats joined 26 Republicans on the committee to advance the bill after a marathon markup session. A week before the House committee focused on the bill in Wednesday's markup — a session in which lawmakers make changes and debate amendments on legislation — the Trump-tied World Liberty Financial (WLFI) announced it's supporting its own stablecoin (USD1). Trump has been highly active in crypto, including in selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and memecoin $TRUMP, even as he pushes for crypto-friendly policies at the federal level.U.S. regulation of stablecoins — generally dollar-tied tokens, such as Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC — is one of the two top policy priorities for the industry. And committee Chairman French Hill argued on the industry's behalf that \"innovation needs guardrails, not roadblocks.\"Republican members declined to discuss President Trump's industry involvement in any explicit terms. When Waters and other Democrats pushed amendments to block the potential conflicts raised by the president's business interests and his direct authority over regulators who would make decisions about stablecoins, they were rejected by the panel's Republicans, who repeatedly called such protections \"unnecessary.\"\"We don't discriminate on entrepreneurs based on who they are and where they come from,\" Hill said. If the government wants clear guardrails around this space, he repeatedly argued, the best move is to pass the bill that establishes oversight. Representative Maxine Waters, the senior Democrat on the panel, said that Trump \"leveraged the power of the presidency to establish multiple crypto schemes to enrich himself and his family,\" calling it a \"display of greed.\"\"He's unlike any other issuer, because he's the president of the United States,\" said Representative Stephen Lynch, the ranking Democrat on the panel's digital assets subcommittee, who argued Trump would be in a position to sign off on any government help needed by his own business interests were they to fail. \"If this was a Democratic president who was trying to do this, the Republicans' hair would be on fire, and rightly so. This should not be happening.\"Another Democrat, Illinois Representative Sean Castin, argued that Tron's Justin Sun has put tens of millions of dollars into WLFI for no clear return other than its relationship to the Trump family. He contended that government officials tied to stablecoins could be influenced by foreign investors in a way that's hidden from public scrutiny. The Democratic arguments failed to move the committee's Republican majority, so no new amendments stuck to the effort. Supporters have said this House version is largely parallel to the Senate's. Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican, said the House version properly maintains sufficient authority in the hands of state regulators, which offers a \"lighter touch, at times.\"\"We have an administration that is ready to embrace these products, and the time is now,\" Huizenga said.This was one of a few bills before the House Financial Services Committee dealing with crypto-tied topics. Another piece of legislation debated on Wednesday was one that would form a cross-government group of law-enforcement agencies to address illicit crypto use and another that would ban U.S.-issued central bank digital currency (CBDC). Lawmakers also voted on dozens of amendments to the stablecoin bill before voting to advance the bill itself, prompting Rep. Lynch to joke that the panel may have set a record for the most failed votes in a row. The cross-government bill, the Financial Technology Protection Act, passed with unanimous support, 49-0. The anti-CBDC bill passed with 27 votes, with 22 lawmakers voting against. Though lawmakers initially had issues with their electronic voting system, they began making good time after starting votes near 10:30 p.m. ET – nearly 12.5 hours after the markup began. Voting on all five bills wrapped up by 11:15 p.m. ET. As the stablecoin bill continues to move forward, Trump is also poised to sign the first pro-crypto congressional action: a resolution that erases an Internal Revenue Service rule that targeted decentralized finance (DeFi) operations. The president is expected to sign the resolution, though he hasn't announced a schedule to do so.UPDATE (March 3, 2025, 01:15 UTC): Adds vote totals.",

    "title": "Bitcoin Nears Death Cross, Yuan Tumbles With Asian Markets After Trump Tariffs Put Focus on China's Response",
    "content": "It's a risk-off day in Asia as traders look to Beijing's response to U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping reciprocal tariffs on China and other Asian nations.On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs on imports from 180 nations, including trading partners identified as the worst offenders, such as China and the European Union.The president imposed a new 34% tariff on goods from China in addition to the existing 20% tax, bringing the total levy to 54%, the highest for any nation. The action did not affect Canada and Mexico.Observers say the ball is now in China's court, and the nature of its retaliation could determine the market reaction.\"Everything now depends on China. If China devalues the Yuan in response to today's large, additional US tariffs, that sets off a global risk-off that hits EMs first and then - if it persists - spills back to the US. China has so far kept a very low profile. That may now end,\" Robin Brooks, managing director and chief economist at the International Institute of Finance, said on X.Early Thursday, China urged the U.S. to lift tariffs while vowing immediate retaliation. Meanwhile, the yuan weakened to a seven-week low of 7 against the dollar alongside losses in the Asian equities and an impending death cross in bitcoin (BTC).Letting the yuan depreciate, which makes Chinese goods cheaper in international markets, is one way to counter the tariffs. That said, it could spell trouble for carry (currency) trades and scare financial markets, as observed in 2015 and 2018.Besides, potential intervention by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to stall a rapid yuan decline can boost the dollar, inadvertently weighing on risk assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies.It's no coincidence that Asian equities traded in the red at press time, with Japan's Nikkei hitting an eight-month low. U.S. stock futures fell over 2%, pointing to risk-off mode.Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded near $83,300, having dropped from $88,000 to $82,500 following Trump's tariffs announcement, according to CoinDesk market data. The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of the cryptocurrency's spot price appears on track to cross below its 200-day SMA, confirming what is known as the \"death cross\" bearish technical pattern.Though it has a mixed record of predicting price trends, the latest cross happening against the backdrop of escalating trade tensions warrants attention — more so, as options pricing now shows bias for puts, or downside protection, out to the June-end expiry, according to Deribit and Amberdata.",

Chart analysts identify targets using the measure move method, which involves determining the distance from the top of the head to the neckline and subtracting that distance from the breakdown point, in this case, $2.On the higher side, $3, or the lower high created in early March, is the level to beat for the bulls.",

    "content": "Higher-than-usual market volatility affected bulls and bears alike as crypto futures racked up $450 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours as U.S. tariffs went into play.President Donald Trump officially levied a 25% tariff on auto imports and a minimum 10% tariff on all exporters to the U.S. Additional duties were imposed on the nation’s biggest trading partners in Asia and the European Union, with China facing a 50% hike on several goods and a 26% fee on some Indian goods.Turmoil in markets ensued with gains from the past three days wiped out in U.S. indices and cryptocurrencies. Asian markets tumbled early Thursday and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields slumped to the lowest level in more than five months. Gold set yet another record high.Bitcoin inched above $87,000 as investors hoped for leaner long-term effects of the economic changes, with signs of a risk-on environment emerging at the start of the week. Majors ether (ETH) and xrp (XRP) traded above $1,900 and $2.15, respectively, with technical analysis suggesting higher moves in the near term.But the euphoria was short-lived as crypto majors dipped as much as 5% from Wednesday’s highs before gradually stabilizing. In Asian morning hours on Thursday, bitcoin traded just above $83,500 while ether traded slightly over $1,800 — effectively reversing all gains from Tuesday after a sudden drop following the Tokyo open.That caused over $230 million in liquidations on both bullish and bearish bets, data shows, in an unusual move. BTC-tracked futures registered over $172 million in long and short liquidations alone, followed by ETH futures at $120 million and smaller altcoins at $50 million.Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).Single-sided large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly. However, Thursday’s liquidations can be considered a sign of market uncertainty.",

That came as Ripple added the stablecoin to its official payments product, with payment providers BKK Forex and iSend already said to be using the stablecoin.Industry leaders expect RLUSD to further shift crypto market dynamics, where upstarts tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) could see competition from Ripple’s product.XRP Ledger-based decentralized financial (DeFi) applications could be a cohort to watch for as RLUSD gains traction on various platforms, boosting XRP token demand.RLUSD is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, offered on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchain. It is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and cash equivalents.To maintain its peg, RLUSD relies on a 1:1 reserve system—each token matches an equivalent fiat value.Users can mint RLUSD by depositing dollars with authorized partners, who issue tokens, or burn RLUSD to redeem cash. Market arbitrage helps stabilize its price: if RLUSD trades below $1, traders buy it to redeem at par, raising demand; if above $1, they mint more, increasing supply.Security features make RLUSD appealing to institutional users. An XRP Ledger amendment in January saw a “clawback” feature go live on the network, allowing the issuer to reclaim or \"claw back\" certain tokens, such as RLUSD, from users' wallets under specific conditions.This feature is typically implemented for regulatory compliance, to recover assets in cases of fraud, illegal activities, or when tokens are sent to unintended addresses.",

    "title": "U.S. Recession Odds Surge in Prediction Markets on Tariff Shock. What Next for BTC?",
    "content": "U.S. recession fears are in the air following President Donald Trump's tariff plan, with prediction platforms Polymarket and Kalshi indicating heightened concerns the economy will take a hit.On Polymarket, a decentralized prediction platform, the chance of the country slipping into recession this year topped 50% for the first time since the betting contract \"US Recession in 2025\" began trading early this year. The contract's Yes shares soared to over 50 cents from 39 cents in less than 24 hours. The contract will resolve to Yes if the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) confirms a recession at any point before Dec. 31. The other condition requires back-to-back quarterly contractions in gross domestic product.Kalshi, a U.S.-based regulated prediction market, also points to heightened economic concerns among traders, with the probability of a 2025 recession rising to 54% from 40% .Financial markets tend to be forward-looking and may react to rising U.S. recession odds by sending risk assets such as bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies lower. At publication time, the S&P 500 futures traded 3% lower, pointing to severe risk aversion on Wall Street and offering bearish cues to bitcoin, which changed hands at $83,100, 1.5% lower in 24 hours.The sweeping tariffs unveiled Wednesday set a base rate of 10% on all imports, plus higher taxes on 60 nations identified as worst offenders. China, the most heavily hit, warranted a 34% levy on top of the existing 20% charge, taking the total to 54%. The base tariffs go into effect on April 5 and the higher reciprocal rates on April 9.While the Trump administration expects tariffs to rectify the large and persistent U.S. goods trade deficits, in the short run, they could add to domestic inflation and global instability. The latter could happen immediately if China, the European Union and others hit back with higher tariffs, starting a full-blown global trade war.Risk-off to be short-lived?Still, some observers say the tariff uncertainty might lead only to an economic slowdown rather than a full-blown recession.\"The threat of further tariff escalation remains a key concern, but our economic forecasts do not call for a recession in the US,\" UBS said in a blog post. \"In our base case, a wide range of selective tariffs and counteractions are likely to lead to slower economic growth compared to last year, but they should not prevent the US economy from expanding by around 2%—its historical trend rate—this year.\" As for financial markets, some observers say the tariffs are dovish, meaning the initial risk-off reaction could be short-lived and quickly reversed by expectations of Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts.\"Remember - tariffs are dovish, and big tariffs are very dovish,\" Joseph Wang, operator of the research portal fedguy.com said on X, referring to his November post that detailed how big tariffs would lead to more rate cuts.Wang argued that while tariffs are inflationary, they can be mitigated through foreign-exchange rates and are ultimately transitory. Meanwhile, damage to the business sentiment can be long-lasting, leading to unemployment, which the Fed would want to avoid.Rates traders are already pricing a higher probability that the Fed will cut the benchmark borrowing cost in June, restarting the so-called easing cycle that began in September last year.",

He released a statement saying that he's aware of multiple reports this year of alleged fraud exploiting trust companies, and acknowledged that local regulation needs to be improved.First Digital Trust denies all allegationsAfter Sun's press conference, First Digital Trust held its own event on X, with CEO Vincent Chok saying Sun had yet to produce \"one solid piece of evidence\" to back up his claims.FDT followed its fiduciary duties, acted in clients' best interests, complied with instructions from Sun and his nominees, which were signed off by Techteryx directors, and noted that the company is subject to third-party audits, Chok said.Chok, however, acknowledged he was previously unaware of the familial connection between Aria CFF and Aria DMCC — the funds where TUSD's reserves are held up.In a complaint to the Department of Justice, Techteryx noted that Aria CFF, the fund it said is authorized to hold TrueUSD's reserves is managed by Matthew Brittain. Aria DMCC, which Techteryx said is unauthorized, is controlled by his spouse, Cecilia Brittain.Chok said FDT is working to recover funds, but know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) issues involving the ultimate beneficial owner of Techteryx are apparently holding things up.He also rejected Sun's claims in a post on X that First Digital Trust is unable to fulfill redemption obligations of its FDUSD stablecoin. The token is still very much solvent, Chok said.FDT said it plans to pursue legal action over Sun's claims. Earlier, the company posted examples of on-chain data showing redemptions going through.",

    "title": "Bitcoin’s Hash Rate Hits Record High, Yet Price and Activity Tell Another Story",
    "content": "Bitcoin blockchain's hashrate is surging, revealing a growing dislocation between the network activity and prices for its native token bitcoin (BTC). On a 14-day moving average, the hashrate, representing the computational power required to mine a block on the proof-of-work Bitcoin blockchain, recently reached an all-time high of 838 exahashes per second (EH/s), and on a 24-hour time frame, it spiked to 974 EH/s, the second highest level ever, according to Glassnode data. Measuring over a 24-hour window can be misleading due to block time variability, so longer timeframes give more reliable insights. In two days, Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment — which recalibrates every 2016 blocks to maintain a 10-minute block interval — is expected to increase by over 3%, reaching a new peak.This divergence between hash rate and price is notable. While bitcoin remains about 25% below its all-time high, mining costs continue to rise. For miners to stay profitable and cover operational expenses and capital expenditures, a strong bitcoin price, full blocks and high transaction fees are essential.Currently, miners earn revenue through two channels: block rewards (3.125 BTC per block in the current epoch) and transaction fees. However, transaction fees are extremely low — averaging around 4 BTC per day, or roughly $377,634. As bitcoin’s block subsidy continues to halve every four years, sustained or increasing transaction activity will be critical to maintaining mining incentives.Near empty blocksDeveloper Mononaut, from Mempool, recently noted that Foundry USA Pool mined the emptiest \"non-empty\" block in over two years, containing just seven transactions — a rarity only surpassed by a block with four transactions back in January 2023.In other words, while the rising hashrate paints a picture of a booming network, the near-empty blocks make it the case of a powerful train speeding down the tracks but without passengers. That's a cause for concern for Nicolas Gregory, creator of the Mercury Layer and a former Nasdaq Board Director.“Half-empty bitcoin blocks tell a tale — hawking the store-of-value line could scupper its future,\" Gregory said on X.\"I hope bitcoiners realize this space is more than just podcasts, spaces, and the ‘number go up’ digital gold narrative. If we don’t get people using bitcoin for real commerce, it’s game over,\" Gregory added.",

As the chief investment officer at Bitwise, Hougan provides an in-depth analysis, explaining why, from a risk-adjusted perspective, there has never been a more opportune time to buy Bitcoin.In our discussion, Hougan lays out a compelling argument: Bitcoin&rsquo;s early days were filled with uncertainty &mdash; technology risks, regulatory threats, trading inefficiencies, and reputational concerns. Fast forward to today, and those risks have significantly diminished. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs, adoption by major institutional investors, and even the US government&rsquo;s strategic Bitcoin reserve have all cemented its place in the global financial ecosystem. &ldquo;Bitcoin is only 10% of gold. So just to match gold, which I think is just a stopping point on its long-term journey, it has to ten-x from here,&rdquo; he said. But that&rsquo;s just the beginning. Hougan also touches on Bitcoin&rsquo;s long-term price potential, why institutional adoption is about to accelerate, and how market fundamentals could push Bitcoin to new heights. &ldquo;There's just too much structural long-term demand that has to come into this market against a severely limited new supply,&rdquo; he said.Watch the full interview now on our YouTube channel, and don&rsquo;t forget to subscribe!",

This negative setup could start a downward move to $1.27. There is support at $1.77, but it is likely to be broken.On the upside, a break and close above the 50-day SMA ($2.39) suggests solid buying at lower levels.

Currently, Bitcoin is emerging from a ten-week downtrend that began on Jan. 20 when the price peaked at $110,000. A decisive close above the trendline might lead to continued bullish momentum for Bitcoin in the coming days.Bitcoin 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewBitcoin spot traders drive the rallyThroughout March, spot traders on Binance and Coinbase held opposite stances in the market. Binance traders were aggressive BTC sellers, while Coinbase showed significant spot bids around the $80,000 price level. This dynamic contributed to the sideways price action during the majority of March. Fast forward to April, and spot traders on major exchanges have collectively turned bullish over the past three days. Binance, Coinbase spot buyers data. Source: Aggr.tradeData from aggr.trade highlights that Coinbase and Binance spot bids are driving positive action for BTC. The buying pressure is particularly high on Coinbase, with spot bids increasing as high as $7.98 million over the past few hours. Likewise, Dom, a crypto markets analyst, pointed out that Bitcoin&rsquo;s current rally is possibly due to Binance sellers tapering off. The analyst said, &ldquo;BTC has been able to breathe ever since the Binance selling tapered off. We are even seeing some spot buying from them for the first time in over a week.&rdquo;Related: Bitcoin breaks $86K as US tariff 'Liberation Day' risks 11% BTC price dipBitcoin flips key resistance at $84,000 to $85,000From a technical perspective, Bitcoin has flipped an important resistance range between $84,000 and $85,000 into support. Likewise, the cryptocurrency has attained a bullish position above the 50-day, 100-day and 200-day exponentially moving averages (EMAs). Bitcoin 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewHowever, based on the external liquidity levels between $87,700 and $88,700, which formed the previous highs, BTC prices might struggle to break this range immediately. Consolidation between the green box (as illustrated in the chart) is likely a net positive, which might fuel BTC&rsquo;s $90,000 retest for the first time since March 7. On the flip side, an immediate correction to the current support at $84,000 and $85,000 could possibly discourage bulls, and short sellers might take control of price action. Bullish invalidation could be on the cards if BTC price closes below $85,000 over the next few days. With markets bracing for further market volatility ahead of President Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;Liberation Day&rdquo; tariffs, Bitcoin price is expected to react further during today&rsquo;s White House press conference at 4 pm Eastern Time.

    "content": "West Virginia&rsquo;s Bitcoin (BTC) strategic reserve bill would give the state more sovereignty from the federal government and freedom from a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC), State Senator Chris Rose told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview.&ldquo;You hear these rumors that there are people at the federal government that will want to have a central bank digital currency,&rdquo; Rose said. &ldquo;And people don&rsquo;t want that. People want decentralized currency. They want freedom.&rdquo;The bill, introduced in February, seeks to allow the state treasury to invest up to 10% of public funds in precious metals like gold and silver, stablecoins, or any digital asset that has had a $750 million market capitalization or higher over the last 12 months. Currently, the only digital asset with such a market cap is Bitcoin.West Virginia State Senator Chris Rose. Source: CointelegraphRose, the bill's sponsor, said that the reason they decided on the market cap requirement was to allow the state to have exposure to cryptocurrency, but not to get trapped &ldquo;in any things like memecoins.&rdquo;Adopting Bitcoin on the state level would &ldquo;give us a little more state sovereignty,&rdquo; Rose added. &ldquo;And I think that&rsquo;s one reason why you see a lot of people who normally buy [Bitcoin] for themselves want to see their state government do the same.&rdquo;He added that a 10% allocation of state funds would be a &ldquo;good way to introduce [Bitcoin] to the state&rdquo; while avoiding any fear from people who don&rsquo;t understand digital assets. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good way to cap that where they feel comfortable, but also give us at least a decent exposure as well.&rdquo;Bitcoin: &ldquo;A very powerful&rdquo; investment and freedom toolRose said that one of the roadblocks to getting the bill passed is fear, in particular among those who don't understand cryptocurrency. &ldquo;Just like any other state, we have people who understand it. We also have people that don&rsquo;t understand it, and people are always afraid of what they don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;He added that &ldquo;once they understand it, they realize it&rsquo;s a very powerful investment tool and freedom tool for every one of us to adopt.&rdquo;Excerpt of West Virginia Bitcoin reserve bill. Source: West Virginia LegislatureWest Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey, who has envisioned a future state economy powered by crypto and other tech, won&rsquo;t be a roadblock, Rose said. And the state treasurer, whom Rose consulted before introducing the bill, won&rsquo;t either.However, according to WVNews, a West Virginia publication, some lawmakers and financial experts remain skeptical. Investing state funds into Bitcoin may be risky due to the asset&rsquo;s volatility and price swings, which can cause financial instability and make Bitcoin a controversial choice for state investments.Although Bitcoin strategic reserve bills have been popping up in state legislatures around the United States, some bills have failed to pass or have scrapped key provisions, including some of those in traditionally conservative states.Currently, 47 strategic Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced in 26 states according to Bitcoin Laws. While, in most of the states, the bills have only been introduced or referred to committees, some have made headway in three: Arizona, Oklahoma, and Texas.Related: Texas Senate passes Bitcoin strategic reserve billRose clarified that the 10% of state funds allocated to precious metals, stablecoins, or Bitcoin would be sourced from two key areas.&ldquo;It would be the assets under the pensions fund and under the severance tax fund,&rdquo; Rose said. &ldquo;They would be able to divest some of those ETF funds into these assets. We wanted to keep it separate from the petty cash fund, which is day-to-day, just paying the bills of the state.

    "content": "Ether (ETH) price has risen 6.4% from its March 30 $1,768 low but the altcoin has struggled to regain the $2,000 level. Some traders believe that the downturn is partially connected to the deflating memecoin market, which, while not exclusive to the Ethereum network, significantly reduced activity across the decentralized applications (DApps) ecosystem and broader crypto space.Ether is currently 44% down year-to-date, and derivatives metrics indicate that traders are far from bullish and show little confidence in a strong recovery in the near term. Proof of this can be found in the premium on Ether futures relative to spot markets.&nbsp;While the figure rose to 4% on April 2, up from 2% on March 31, it is still below the neutral 5% threshold. This data indicates that Ether investors remain far from turning bullish, despite the strengthening support at the $1,800 price level.Ether 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.chTo assess whether whales and market makers lack confidence in Ether&rsquo;s performance, one should analyze the ETH options market. Under neutral conditions, the 25% delta skew should be balanced between call (buy) and put (sell) options, typically ranging from -6% to 6%.Deribit ETH 30-day options 25% delta skew (put-call). Source: Laevitas.chThe Ether delta skew metric has retreated from the 9% level seen on March 31, yet the current 7% reading suggests that risk-aversion sentiment remains strong. The rising cost of hedging indicates that whales fear further downside for ETH, suggesting it may take longer for traders to regain confidence.Ethereum adoption remains strong despite DApps revenue dropIt&rsquo;s easy to attribute much of Ether&rsquo;s price decline to the 49% drop in Ethereum DApps revenue between January and March. However, while the reduced network activity limits the influx of new users and dampens overall demand for ETH, its advantages over traditional financial markets and its dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) remain unchanged.The stablecoin holdings on Ethereum are nearing an all-time high of $124.5 billion, and Ethereum is still the undisputed leader, with $49 billion in total value locked (TVL). This data suggests significant potential for ETH adoption, particularly as new use cases emerge, such as structured products and more complex DeFi applications leveraging synthetic assets.Despite the early struggles of metaverse applications, declining interest in memecoins, and the sharp downturn in non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace activity, the Ethereum network continues to expand.ETH funding rate neutral as ETFs dampen retail trading enthusiasmInstead of focusing solely on how professional traders are positioned, it is also valuable to assess retail investors&rsquo; sentiment. Perpetual futures (inverse swaps) typically follow spot prices closely, as leverage imbalances are corrected through a fee known as the funding rate, which is charged every eight hours. In neutral markets, this rate fluctuates between 0.1% and 0.3% over a seven-day period.Ether 8-hour perpetual futures funding rate. Source: Laevitas.chThe ETH perpetual funding rate has been neutral since March 31, indicating that retail traders are not attempting to catch a falling knife. A key factor behind this lack of enthusiasm is the spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which saw $37 million in net outflows over the past two weeks.While derivatives data is often backward-looking and does not necessarily signal further ETH price declines, sentiment could shift quickly given the positive momentum from the Trump family&rsquo;s World Liberty Financial investment in ETH and Eric Trump&rsquo;s vocal support for Ether. For the time being, professional traders and retail investors remain cautious about ETH&rsquo;s price outlook.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

It also uses a technology that binds a verified identity to a public key through digital signatures to try to stem counterparty risk.Nixed Tornado Cash sanctions &ldquo;helped people feel comfortable&rdquo;Brody said the US Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions on the crypto mixing service Tornado Cash &ldquo;had a chilling effect on legitimate business user interest.&rdquo;&ldquo;Even though we long ago took steps to make Nightfall unattractive to bad actors, since it cannot be used anonymously, the removal of OFAC sanctions has really helped people feel comfortable that using a privacy technology will not be risky,&rdquo; he added.Nightfall&rsquo;s code is open source on GitHub but remains a permissioned blockchain for EY&rsquo;s customer base, competing with the likes of the IBM-backed Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda and the Consensus-built Quorum.Brody said that EY&rsquo;s blockchain team is working toward &ldquo;a single environment that supports payments, logic, and composability.&rdquo;Currently, the firm requires Nightfall and Starlight, a tool that can change smart contract code to enable zero-knowledge proofs &ldquo;to enable complex multiparty business agreements under privacy,&rdquo; he added.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll spend some time supporting Nightfall_4 deployments initially,&rdquo; Brody said. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll move on to the development of Nightfall_5.&rdquo;Magazine: What are native rollups?

    "title": "An AI watchdog accused OpenAI of using copyrighted books without permission",
    "content": "An artificial intelligence watchdog is accusing OpenAI of training its default ChatGPT model on copyrighted book content without permission. In a new paper published this week, the AI Disclosures Project alleges that OpenAI likely trained its GPT-4o model using nonpublic material from O’Reilly Media. The researchers used a legally obtained dataset of 34 copyrighted O’Reilly books and found that GPT-4o showed “strong recognition” of the company&#8217;s paywalled content. By contrast, GPT-3.5 Turbo appeared more familiar with publicly accessible O’Reilly book samples. &#8220;These results highlight the urgent need for increased corporate transparency regarding pre-training data sources as a means to develop formal licensing frameworks for AI content training,&#8221; the authors wrote in the paper. Tim O&#8217;Reilly, one of the paper&#8217;s authors, is a cofounder and CEO of O&#8217;Reilly Media. An OpenAI spokesperson didn&#8217;t immediately respond to Fast Company&#8216;s request for comment. Training data lies at the heart of all artificial intelligence models. Large language models (LLMs) require an incredible amount of information that it uses to guide back on when it churns out text or images for users. OpenAI has struck up some licensing deals to be able to train their models on certain content. But the company, which recently fundraised and is worth $300 billion, has also come under fire for sourcing certain content. The New York Times, for example, is leading a charge against OpenAI and minority owner Microsoft over alleged copyright infringement. The researchers acknowledged limitations in their study but argued that the issue is likely part of a broader systemic problem in how large language models are developed. &#8220;Sustainable ecosystems need to be designed so that both creators and developers can benefit from generative AI,&#8221; the authors wrote. &#8220;Otherwise, model developers are likely to rapidly plateau in their progress, especially as newer content becomes produced less and less by humans.&#8221;",

    "title": "Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs could upend global trade",
    "content": "The world is bracing for impact as the so-called &#8220;Liberation Day&#8221; arrives Wednesday—the latest installment of President Trump&#8217;s tariff announcements since his return to office in January. In a Rose Garden address at 4 p.m. ET, the president is set to unveil a sweeping &#8220;reciprocal tariff&#8221; plan, targeting not only Mexico, Canada, and China, but also other countries in a trade surplus with the U.S. or those holding tariffs on American products. It is still unclear what countries and industries will be impacted by today&#8217;s announcement, as well as the rate of tariffs imposed, and if they will be imposed universally or by country. However, the policy changes are said to go into effect after his speech. While much is still uncertain, here is how many world leaders are reacting ahead of Trump&#8217;s &#8220;Liberation Day&#8221; speech. Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum&#8217;s &#8220;cool head&#8221; approach has helped Mexico evade some of Trump&#8217;s tariffs since he first announced 25% levies on Mexican exports in early February. Sheinbaum said Wednesday in her daily morning briefing that she would announce an &#8220;integral plan&#8221; on Thursday. &#8220;Our interest is to strengthen the Mexican economy,&#8221; Sheinbaum said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not an issue of if you tariff me, I tariff you.&#8221; Canada Following on-again-off-again tariffs between the U.S. and Canada—the country America long considered its closest ally—Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney warned Trump that Canada will impose retaliatory tariffs on American exports, although no specifics have been revealed yet. China In early February, Trump imposed a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports, upending a tariff war between the world&#8217;s two largest economies. After the U.S. raised tariffs to 20% in early March, China responded with retaliatory tariffs, with 10% and 15% levies on various food and agricultural goods. Ahead of &#8220;Liberation Day,&#8221; China held economic dialogue with Japan and South Korea, seeking a coordinated response among the three nations. However, Japanese and South Korean officials said that decision was not taken. EU Ahead of the April 2 announcement, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, &#8220;Europe did not start this confrontation, we do not necessarily want to retaliate, but if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it.&#8221; In early March, the European Commission responded to Trump&#8217;s tariffs on aluminum and steel by launching &#8220;swift and proportionate countermeasures on U.S. imports into the EU,&#8221; a statement read. Countermeasures included tariffs on American goods such as bourbon and motorbikes worth up to $28 billion in exports.",

    "title": "Andrew Tate is back—and he’s getting a hero’s welcome from right-wing podcasters",
    "content": "You can’t talk about the manosphere without mentioning Andrew Tate. The British-American influencer and former professional kickboxer built his platform by promoting misogynistic ideas—claiming women should be subservient to men, suggesting rape victims should “bear responsibility” for their assaults, and openly describing acts of domestic violence. The manosphere, which birthed Tate and others like him, is a network of right-wing influencers and grifters who peddle misogyny, toxic masculinity, and regressive gender roles—often aimed at radicalizing disaffected young men. And if Tate and his brother Tristan&#8217;s warm welcome from American right-wing podcasters is any indication, this ideology is no longer confined to the darkest corners of the internet. It&#8217;s creeping into the mainstream. Recently, the Tate brothers were allowed to leave Romania after prosecutors lifted their travel restrictions in late February. The two remain under investigation there for allegedly forming an organized criminal group, human trafficking, trafficking of minors, and money laundering. Shortly after, they landed in the United States. Around the same time, an ex-girlfriend, Brianna Stern, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles accusing Andrew of beating and choking her during their relationship. Now, a new report from Media Matters reveals how several pro-Trump and manosphere-aligned podcasters eagerly welcomed Tate during his U.S. visit. Between February and March, he appeared on the Hodgetwins podcast, the Nelk Boys’ Full Send, Sean Kelly’s Digital Social Hour, Patrick Bet-David’s PBD Podcast, and Candace with Candace Owens. These interviews were shared widely—full episodes uploaded to YouTube, Rumble, Apple Podcasts, and Spotify drew more than 9 million views. Shorter clips posted to social media racked up an additional 30.8 million. The Nelk Boys—Canadian-American YouTubers who began with prank content but now lean into right-wing politics—even walked into a UFC Power Slap event alongside the Tate brothers. There, UFC president and Trump ally Dana White greeted them with a hug and said, “Welcome to the States, boys.” “The current online media ecosystem incentivizes outrage and extremism—and that is exactly what we saw when MAGA and manosphere podcasts platformed Andrew Tate when he returned to the U.S.,&#8221; Kayla Gogarty, research director at Media Matters, tells Fast Company. &#8220;These podcasters allowing Tate to push extreme misogyny and hate to their large followings, and then amplifying clips to millions more, is concerning, as young men that follow these shows can be radicalized down a path that could lead to abuse and violence against women.&#8221; Not everyone on the right embraced Tate’s return. Socially conservative figures such as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis have voiced disgust over the support he’s received. Still, prominent MAGA personalities—including White House counselor Alina Habba, Candace Owens, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump Jr.—remain in his corner.",

    "title": "Musk won’t leave until DOGE mission is complete, White House says",
    "content": "The White House said on Wednesday that tech billionaire Elon Musk will stay on to complete his mission to slash government spending and downsize the federal workforce, dismissing media reports that he will leave the role soon. Politico and ABC reported that President Donald Trump had told members of his Cabinet that Musk will soon depart and return to the private sector, although the reports did not make clear if that would mean Musk leaving before his 130-day mandate as a special government employee is set to expire around late May. Trump has tasked the Tesla and SpaceX CEO with leading efforts through the Department of Government Efficiency to cut government funding and reshape the federal bureaucracy. &#8220;Elon Musk and President Trump have both publicly stated that Elon will depart from public service as a special government employee when his incredible work at DOGE is complete,&#8221; White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said. Musk and DOGE did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the reports. On Tuesday, Musk and Trump suffered a setback as a liberal judge in Wisconsin won election to the state Supreme Court, easily defeating a conservative judge whose campaign had been heavily bankrolled by Musk and groups tied to him. The vote had been seen as an early referendum on Trump&#8217;s presidency and Musk&#8217;s campaign to remake the U.S. civil service. Shares of some government contracting companies rose following the reports of Musk&#8217;s possible impending return to the private sector. Shares of Musk&#8217;s Tesla, which had been down more than 6% in early trading after a sharper-than-expected fall in first-quarter deliveries, reversed course and were up about 5% on Wednesday afternoon. Musk told Fox News&#8217; &#8220;Special Report with Bret Baier&#8221; last week that he was confident he would finish most of his stated aim of cutting $1 trillion in federal spending by the end of his 130 days. But in a March 10 interview with Fox Business Network&#8217;s &#8220;Kudlow,&#8221; when he was asked by host Larry Kudlow, &#8220;You going to go another year?&#8221; Musk replied, &#8220;Yeah, I think so.&#8221; According to the DOGE website, the only official window into its operations, DOGE estimates it has saved U.S. taxpayers $140 billion as of April 2 through a series of actions including workforce reductions, asset sales, and contract cancellations, still far short of Musk&#8217;s $1 trillion goal. But evidence for the stated savings is often missing, and the website&#8217;s calculations have been riddled with errors and corrections. DOGE&#8217;s mandate as a whole is set to continue to July 4, 2026. However, many of the top figures in DOGE are tied to Musk and have not said whether they would want to stay on after the departure of the billionaire, who has been the ideological force behind the government overhaul. There has been growing unease across the U.S. over Musk&#8217;s blunt approach to mass layoffs from the government workforce. Nearly 200,000 employees have been fired, earmarked for termination or have accepted buyouts. Republican lawmakers have faced the wrath of angry voters at unruly town halls, while many of DOGE&#8217;s efforts have become the subject of lawsuits. Tesla dealerships have been vandalized in the U.S. and abroad, and a nationwide protest against DOGE and Trump&#8217;s agenda is planned for this Saturday. —Susan Heavey, Nandita Bose, Andrea Shalal, and Tim Reid, Reuters Additional reporting by Shivani Jayesh Tanna, Akash Sriram, Abhirup Roy, and Sayantani Ghosh.",

The companies said Wednesday that their multiyear partnership will give UFC the ability to use Meta&#8217;s technology platforms, services, and products, including Meta AI, Meta Glasses, Meta Quest, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads, so that UFC fans have more ways to view its content. Meta and UFC, whose parent company is TKO Group, said they will work together to incorporate Meta&#8217;s AI glasses into UFC events. “Meta has the greatest minds in tech and they are going to take fan engagement to the next level,&#8221; UFC President and CEO Dana White said in a statement. White mentioned that Meta is already working on some innovations for a new fighter rankings system. The deal, whose financial terms were not disclosed, will also see the Meta brand appear in UFC&#8217;s Octagon, as well as across numerous broadcasts. Meta&#8217;s social media platform Threads will feature exclusive original UFC content. “I love this sport and I’m looking forward to working with the UFC to let fans experience it in new ways,” Meta Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said. Zuckerberg is trained in mixed martial arts and posted about completing his first jiu jitsu tournament in 2023. That same year, there were talks of him and Tesla CEO Elon Musk squaring off in a&nbsp;“cage match,”&nbsp;but the event never happened. Zuckerberg and White are no strangers to each other, with White&nbsp;joining&nbsp;Meta&#8217;s board of directors in January. Both Zuckerberg and White are among the many high profile business figures within the orbit of President Donald Trump. After Trump won reelection in November,&nbsp;Zuckerberg dined&nbsp;at the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and Meta donated $1 million to Trump’s&nbsp;inauguration fund. Other Big Tech companies such as Amazon have donated similar amounts. Trump is a longtime UFC fan and frequent attendee of major fights. His ties with White date back to 2001, when White hosted a UFC at the Republican’s former casino-hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the Trump Taj Mahal. Trump has also appeared with White at UFC matches over the years, especially in his 2024 campaign as part of efforts to appeal to younger male voters. White has had speaking roles at the 2016, 2020 and 2024 Republican conventions and appeared on stage at Trump’s election victory party in November.

    "title": "The overall cost of raising a child is now nearly $300,000",
    "content": "It’s no secret that raising kids in the U.S. has become grossly expensive. The price of childcare alone has ballooned over the past decade, with many families reporting that it costs them at least a quarter of their annual income. Across many states, families need to earn an average of $180,000 to comfortably afford infant care; the high cost of living in states like California and New York can require an income exceeding $250,000. An increasing burden on families A new analysis by the online lending marketplace LendingTree captures why so many families are struggling to manage the enormous cost of having children. The study found that since 2023, the annual cost of raising a young child has jumped by nearly 36%, coming to about $30,000 per year. Over the course of 18 years, that amounts to almost a whopping $300,000. In four states—Hawaii, North Dakota, Washington, and Maryland—that figure can be well over $300,000, even rising over $360,000. Overall, families report spending nearly 23% of their income on the annual expenses of raising children. Childcare comprises a significant portion of those expenses for families with young kids: According to LendingTree&#8217;s analysis, childcare costs spiked by more than 50% in just the past two years. Childcare centers have always struggled to make ends meet due to the steep cost of labor. As federal funding has dried up following the pandemic, however, that financial strain has only been exacerbated. Beyond childcare The cost of care is just one of the many additional expenses borne by families with children. There&#8217;s the cost of housing, as well as the attendant expenses associated with food, clothing, transportation, and healthcare. The LendingTree analysis found, for example, that food costs jumped by nearly 30% since 2023. That means even in states where childcare is less expensive—like North Dakota—the annual cost of raising children can remain high due to other expenses, like housing. (In fact, the average cost of raising children over 18 years is lower in Massachusetts than it is in North Dakota.) LendingTree&#8217;s findings also indicate that even as these costs rise precipitously, families are receiving less assistance from the government. Between 2023 and 2025, the value of federal tax credits decreased by over 44%, in part because the expanded child tax credit secured by the Biden administration expired. While it&#8217;s true that the cost of childcare continues to be one of the greatest challenges for many families, the financial burden doesn&#8217;t end there—and that&#8217;s unlikely to change without broader federal investment.",

    "title": "Design dignity for those with disabilities",
    "content": "The Fast Company Impact Council is an invitation-only membership community of leaders, experts, executives, and entrepreneurs who share their insights with our audience. Members pay annual dues for access to peer learning, thought leadership opportunities, events and more. A beautiful object, expertly designed, can bring you joy throughout your busy day, unless you are unable to use it because of a permanent, temporary, or situational disability. How does design fail or succeed in creating an inclusive experience for all? As CEO of Michael Graves Design, I am deeply committed to advancing the functionality and accessibility of everyday products, with a special focus on enhancing the lives of those with disabilities. Our mission is to improve quality of life beyond aesthetics, addressing real-world challenges faced by individuals with temporary or permanent disabilities. What drives this commitment? A profound conviction in the transformative power of design to simplify daily tasks and infuse them with dignity and delight. Imagine if every aspect of your daily routine, from waking up to going to bed, was designed with your needs in mind. Activities of daily living (ADLs) such as eating, bathing, dressing, and moving around are foundational to our independence. Yet, for individuals facing temporary or permanent disabilities, these essential tasks can pose significant challenges. This also happens due to situational disabilities that we all experience as we go through our day: full hands, loud environments, low lighting, etc. Design can address these challenges head on, transforming everyday activities into seamless experiences, while enabling us to target the widest audience possible. Focus on consumer experiences over tasks This design philosophy empowers brands to tackle everyday challenges by transforming routine tasks into seamless experiences for consumers. We&#8217;re eager to share our approach, helping you broaden your reach and enhance how you connect with the widest audience possible. Take, for example, our latest collaboration with Pottery Barn. We introduced bedroom furniture that embodies our “design for all” ethos. At first glance, the furniture collections looks like any other Pottery Barn furniture in its catalogue, relaying an aspirational lifestyle that resonates so well with consumers. But a closer look reveals how dignity has been woven into each piece. Beds come with integrated armrests for easier mobility, and nightstands feature enhancements to store CPAP machines and prevent items from tumbling off—just a few of the many simple, yet profound modifications that make independence both accessible and delightful. The twist here is that while these novel functional enhancements were designed around the needs of those with various disabilities, they were designed to be attractive and useful to everybody. A true embodiment of universal design, equal measure is given to the emotional and functional desires of consumers, essential to design for all. This product development strategy is underpinned by decades of research into the needs and preferences of aging adults and those with disabilities. This is not just design—it&#8217;s empathy in action. You must be able to identify real-world problems that need solving, guided by a deep understanding of what people truly desire. Our roadmap is centered on the various ADLs, which are crucial for independent living. The future of design The future of design must be proactive, not reactive. The brands that take this approach will be the leaders of the future. What challenges lie ahead? How can design continue to evolve to meet the unmet needs of our society? To do this successfully, design must merge today’s common expertise in the emotionally driven aspects of a product&#8217;s personality and purpose with the less incorporated ability to include and translate various ability levels as creative constraints in the product development process. In short, new products must be alluring, but push their usefulness to a broader audience. We believe the future is in the merging of these two approaches. To have a pioneering brand today, you need to exceed customers’ expectations for enhanced independence, empowering them with the dignity we all deserve. This is the true power of thoughtful design. It goes beyond making daily tasks possible; it’s about transforming how they’re experienced. Anyone living with a disability knows that interruption, modification, and adaptation become part of the daily habits and rituals. Designing with dignity in mind means designing habits and rituals that can be enjoyed for the long term, through shifting conditions. As we look forward, we must ask ourselves how our work as designers and creators of experiences can continue to break barriers and open doors for all members of society. Challenge yourself to think beyond “human-centered design” and instead widen your aperture to focus on “society-centered design.” Let&#8217;s not just design for some; let’s design for every body, and make every interaction with our products a reaffirmation of our shared humanity.

    "title": "The Tumblr revival is real—and Gen Z is leading the charge",
    "content": "Rumors of a Tumblr comeback have been bubbling for a couple of years—think a pair of Doc Martens here, a splash of pastel hair dye there. Now, Gen Z is embracing the platform as a refuge from an internet saturated with influencers and algorithm fatigue. Launched in 2007, just ahead of Instagram’s 2010 debut, Tumblr, with its blog-style format, encouraged users to craft personal aesthetics and immerse themselves in niche communities—where American Apparel tennis skirts, oversize flannels, and black wire chokers once reigned supreme. At its peak in early 2014, the platform had more than 100 million users and was often mentioned in the same breath as Facebook and other rising social media giants. But Tumblr struggled to monetize, even after Yahoo’s $1.1 billion acquisition in 2013. As competitors leaned into the creator economy with sponsored posts and digital storefronts, Tumblr faded into millennial nostalgia. Thanks to Gen Z, the site has found new life. As of 2025, Gen Z makes up 50% of Tumblr’s active monthly users and accounts for 60% of new sign-ups, according to data shared with Business Insider’s Amanda Hoover, who recently reported on the platform’s resurgence. User numbers spiked in January during the near-ban of TikTok and jumped again last year when Brazil temporarily banned X. In response, Tumblr users launched dedicated communities to archive and share their favorite TikToks. Meanwhile, progressives disillusioned with the political shifts of Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are fleeing Facebook and X in favor of Tumblr’s more independent, chaotic charm. To keep up with the momentum, Tumblr introduced Reddit-style Communities in December, letting users connect over shared interests like photography and video games. In January, it debuted Tumblr TV—a TikTok-like feature that serves as both a GIF search engine and a short-form video platform. But perhaps Tumblr’s greatest strength is that it isn’t TikTok or Facebook. Currently the 10th most popular social platform in the U.S., according to analytics firm Similarweb, Tumblr is dwarfed by giants like Instagram and X. For its users, though, that’s part of the appeal.",

    "title": "Why it can be so hard to get over rejection at work",
    "content": "Work is full of potential rejection. Ask a colleague for a favor, and they may refuse. Apply for a job, and you may not get it. Seek a promotion, and you may be passed over. Submit a proposal to a client, and it may not be accepted. One key part of success is to be willing to learn from these failures, rather than to be paralyzed by them. Yet, you may find it hard to get over a rejection. Before you can learn anything from a failure, you first have to get beyond the emotions associated with rejection. Dealing with rejection sensitivity The first question you have to ask is whether a particular rejection is bothering you, or whether rejection in general is a problem. A long line of research suggests that some people have a high level of rejection sensitivity. There is even a measure of rejection sensitivity called the Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire. This measure asks you to consider a variety of situations in which you ask for something from another person. You rate both the level of anxiety or concern you might experience in that situation as well as the degree to which you expect someone would accept or reject your request. People high in rejection sensitivity get quite anxious when faced with the possibility of rejection and may also expect that their requests will be rejected. Rejection sensitivity may be a reaction people develop to feelings of rejection by key loved ones when growing up. If you generally have anxiety about rejection, then it can hamper you in the workplace. You may avoid asking for things you need or pursuing new opportunities. You may also react with fear or anger when you feel like others are rejecting you. You might also take criticism of a project or your performance as a personal rejection rather than as feedback that provides an opportunity for you to improve. If you&#8217;re sensitive to rejection in general, then you have ingrained a set of habits that probably will not go away on their own. This sensitivity is going to affect both your work and personal life, and so it&#8217;s worth addressing. A good therapist can be a valuable part of the process of understanding the source of your anxiety and expectation of rejection and help you to develop strategies to help you handle future situations more effectively. Dealing with a specific painful rejection Even if you’re not a rejection-sensitive person, you may still find a particular rejection at work hard to handle. Perhaps you had a trusted friend or colleague who has now turned your back on you. Maybe a longtime client has decided to work with someone else. You might have applied for a job that you really wanted and lost out to another candidate. Of course, nobody should expected to get over a rejection immediately. Rejection stings, and that pain can last for a while. Sleep is an important part of your ability to deal with difficult emotions, so getting several good nights&#8217; sleep can help you move past a painful rejection. If there&#8217;s a specific rejection that stays with you, it probably reflects a significant loss for you that is worth understanding. You might be prone to avoid thinking about rejections, but it can be helpful to write about them. That writing can help you to get the thoughts outside of yourself, which can be healing. In addition, it may help you to understand the source of the loss. Perhaps you feel betrayed by someone you trusted. It might be that the rejection affects something that is part of your self-concept. The rejection might feel like it is closing off a career or life path that you were invested in. If writing about the rejection doesn’t help, you might benefit from working with a counselor or therapist. Career success ultimately requires that you put yourself in situations in which you could face rejection. Not only that, it&#8217;s virtually impossible to do anything of significance without being rejected often. That means you must develop strategies to learn to accept rejections, to analyze them so that you learn how to be more effective in the future, and to continue to try difficult things that might lead to additional rejections in the future.",

    "content": "Catfishing. Once a trend confined to the realm of online dating. Now, like other relationship phenomena including ghosting, career cushioning, and quiet quitting, it’s infiltrated the workplace. This is bad for employers and employees alike.&nbsp; Corporate catfishing is when employers make false or misleading claims about their working culture in job ads or interviews in a bid to attract top talent, and it’s a big issue. Research shows that 70% of hiring managers have lied to candidates during hiring processes. A separate study also found that 72% of workers have experienced “shift shock,” where the reality of a new job doesn’t live up to what you were sold.&nbsp; The reason it’s happening is simple. Companies want to attract the best talent to fill skills gaps and drive performance. Yet presently, employers and employees have conflicting preferences over ideal working environments. The return-to-office movement is a prime example.&nbsp; In fact, our data shows that demand for fully remote jobs rose by 10% across last year, and by the end of 2024, almost two-thirds of workers sought remote roles. Yet, only 4% of employers advertised fully remote roles last year. The lack of remote roles on offer is unsurprising given that we’ve recently seen a spate of return-to-office mandates issued by companies including Amazon and JP Morgan. In comes corporate catfishing: a half-baked solution some companies use when they cannot (or will not) offer what workers want. Maybe the hiring manager lies about how often employees are expected to show up to the office, or tells an applicant that the company is deeply committed to environmental efforts, when it’s actually been scaling back on its sustainability goals. Like with all lies, the truth will eventually come back to bite them. While corporate catfishing may widen your talent pool, there’s no guarantee that this pool will be filled with the right talent. Workers are looking for certain working setups for a reason. For example, they could be looking for a remote role because they have a health condition that makes it tricky to go into the office every day, or need working hours that they can flex around the school run. Job seekers lured in under false pretenses are likely to be a poor cultural fit for the company’s working environment. Plus, if workers do fall for corporate catfishing and are hired, they certainly won’t trust or feel loyal to that employer once they discover the truth of the working environment. This won’t be good for staff retention and could be costly for businesses, given that replacing a single employee can cost up to twice their annual salary.&nbsp; There’s also the reputational risks to consider. Smart job seekers will do a deep dive and look at online reviews from former employees before they accept roles. When the secret gets out (and it always does), the company’s reputation for lying to candidates will likely impact job offer acceptance rates and deter future prospects. Businesses will be far better off if they’re transparent about their benefits and working environments from the outset. But the smartest employers won’t stop there. More than ever, workers care not only about where they work, but how, when, and who they work for. So if employers really want to build job seekers&#8217; trust and set themselves apart in the war for top talent, they need to go one step further. They need to build a strong, genuine employer brand, which actively showcases everything from the company’s working setup and benefits to its mission and values. To do this, employers should identify three core themes, which encapsulate the company’s unique value as an employer (be that a commitment to diversity and inclusion or an industry-leading vacation allowance). More than three, and your core identity can get lost in the noise. Sticking to these themes will help keep messaging feeling authentic and consistent across job ads, the company’s website, and social media. Having guidelines around tone of voice can complement this well, too. Showing, not just telling, workers what it’s really like to work for the company also helps build job-seekers’ trust in the employer brand. So, share pictures from team days and events on the company’s social media. Featuring posts from employees from all levels of the businesses, where they share their typical work day or professional achievements facilitated by company training programs or mentorship, can be a great way to do this. The content will feel more authentic to job seekers when it comes from their peers. You should also post about things which reflect the company’s core values on LinkedIn. This helps demonstrate to job seekers that the values the company shouts about really are embedded into its DNA. For instance, if sustainability is important to you, you could post about another company’s new climate initiative. We already have enough catfishing to dodge in the dating world. It’s time for employers to leave false promises behind and put transparency first. There’s someone out there for everyone, and getting more candid about workplace culture means everyone wins—both workers and employers can find their ideal match.&nbsp;",

    "content": "For those tired of waiting in line to buy a new smartphone or anxiously refreshing a delivery tracking site to make sure a new phone arrives intact, Verizon&#8217;s Straight Talk Wireless brand is offering another option: phones from a vending machine. Straight Talk, a Verizon prepaid brand exclusively available at Walmart, has launched vending machines that dispense packaged iPhone and Android devices, similar to the tech vending machines often seen at airports. Customers can browse phones and plans via a touchscreen interface, then pick and pay for what they want, all without needing to wait for a salesperson.&nbsp; And when they take their new phone out of the box, it&#8217;s already activated and ready to make calls. That saves a potentially complex step for customers who would otherwise have to go home and figure out how to activate the device and add prepaid credit to it. [Photo: Straight Talk] &#8220;A lot of our customers, they get confused with what to do at home,&#8221; says David Kim, chief revenue officer at Verizon Value, which includes the telecom giant&#8217;s prepaid brands. &#8220;It drives calls to care. It drives customer dissatisfaction.&#8221; Even if potential customers aren&#8217;t ready to buy, they can use the machines to see what phone and plan deals are available without needing to wait on a sales rep, Kim says. And if they do have questions they&#8217;d want answered by a human being, the wait time will likely be shorter, since other customers can conduct their business with the machine. So far, the new machines are installed in five Walmart stores, where they&#8217;ve sold hundreds of phones after thousands of interactions. Verizon plans to add them at nearly 100 more Walmart locations over the course of the year. In some cases, Verizon is testing the machines near the department in the rear of the store where phones are normally sold, but the company is also testing other locations, including near the checkout, where customers can easily browse the machine to see what&#8217;s available. [Photo: Straight Talk] &#8220;As customers are checking out, they&#8217;re interacting with the machine just to see what&#8217;s the latest and greatest,&#8221; Kim says. The company is also testing payment methods, including cash and card. So far, most people are paying by credit or debit, with some signing up for monthly autopay via the machine. But the machines are likely to continue to support cash as they expand to more stores, Kim says. After developing the technology to ensure phones can be uniquely identified, tracked, and activated within the machine, the company continues to optimize how to highlight different phones for customers, including making them aware of various brands, price points, and special offers.&nbsp; And in addition to expanding at Walmart, Verizon Value—which offers eight brands at more than 100,000 locations across the United States—may also roll out vending machines to support its other lines at both other national retailers. While the company does need to ensure machines have internet connectivity and staffing to keep them stocked, selling no-contract prepaid phones is in some ways easy compared to selling phones on a contract, since there&#8217;s no need to check customer IDs or conduct a credit check. Expansion possibilities may also include smaller devices offering other services, like letting people pay for a month of service without needing to purchase a prepaid card, Kim says. Other options being considered include machines at airports, which could offer prepaid phones or SIM cards to international travelers, and at existing retail locations for various Verizon Value brands. &#8220;It&#8217;s just a matter of picking the right locations,&#8221; he says.",

    "title": "The secret to a successful job search? An accountability buddy",
    "content": "Job searching can feel like a full-time job in and of itself. Endless networking coffees and cover letter drafts can make it easy to get discouraged. And while it’s helpful to get support from family, friends, and your significant other, they may not truly grasp the day-to-day grind that’s needed to keep the momentum going.&nbsp; In fact, for many, searching for a job is an isolating experience. According to a recent American Staffing Association/Harris Poll Workforce Monitor survey, 72% of Americans say applying for jobs can feel like sending résumés into a “black box.” And four out of 10 unemployed U.S. job seekers revealed they didn’t land a single job interview in a year.&nbsp; This cycle of applying for jobs and not hearing back can lead to frustration, hopelessness and loneliness, says Richard Wahlquist, chief executive officer at the American Staffing Association. One way to keep up a productive job search is to find a job-search partner. Experts say this support can help keep you motivated and feeling supported. Here’s how to best work with another job searcher to both secure new roles: 1. You’ll gain an extra set of eyes and ears There’s only so many hours in the day and so many networking channels one can explore. So, having a job partner—especially one searching in the same industry—can double your outreach. “They can identify job openings you missed,” says Wahlquist.&nbsp; 2. They can help you polish your materials and prep for interviews A job search partner can not only assist with proofreading, but they can also offer you a fresh perspective on your cover letter, and provide suggestions on how to customize your résumé for each position you apply for. Interview prep is also paramount, and Walhquist says a job search partner can provide very helpful roleplay as you practice answering challenging interview questions. These exercises can improve your communication skills and boost your confidence. 3. They can help you stay motivated Knowing that someone depends on your support can be motivating. “There’s an extra layer of accountability on days when the last thing you feel like doing is applying for another job,” says Wahlquist.&nbsp; How to choose a job search buddy It’s a personal decision whether to partner with a job seeker in your same industry—and of course depends on who you know who might also be searching for a job at the same time. Here are a few reasons why picking someone in the same field can be helpful: They understand the industry. Jenny Wood, a career-development expert and author of the new book Wild Courage: Go After What You Want and Get It, says picking a person in your field can be a good move, even if you’re worried about potential competition. “There are hundreds of thousands of jobs out there,” says Wood. “They only need one and you only need one. There are enough to go around.” They can give real feedback. Not only can they help you choose winning résumé keywords and bullet points, an insider can also help you grasp “what a solid versus mediocre answer is to an interview question,” says Wood. They’ll also better understand what certain role descriptions mean when you are both searching and applying. How to be sure a job search partner adds value Gaining support can only help you on your employment journey. “Job seekers who end up with the most options and, eventually, the best jobs are the ones who enlist as many people and resources as possible to support their job searches,” says Walhquist. But be sure to keep an eye on the prize of getting a job, and keep the interactions productive. “While it may be comforting to constantly touch base with your job search partner, make sure the relationship is not getting in the way of your actual search,” says Wahlquist. “Sitting in a café with your friend may be fun, but at the end of the day, you have to actually do the work to apply for jobs.” How often to check in The frequency of check-ins depends on the individuals involved, says Matthew A. Solit, LMSW, executive clinical director with LifeStance Health. “Weekly may work for some, but for others, higher frequency can increase accountability.” It’s all about what works for you and your accountability partner or partners. “Mutually agreed upon communication patterns and a framework for accountability is key to a good working partnership,” adds Solit. What to do when one of you gets a job There is a high likelihood that one member of the partnership will be offered a position before the other. And, says Solit, when one member of the team succeeds, everyone succeeds. “It’s not a race, and it’s not about winning or losing,” says Solit. “It is important to continue to support your job-search peers even if you are hired first and to see the mutual commitment to accountability through to the end for both members.”",

    "title": "A once-abandoned parking garage in Buenos Aires is now a stunning tower with a park on top",
    "content": "Four years ago, if you found yourself at one particular intersection of Buenos Aires, you would see a nondescript, three-story parking garage with no cars inside. That building still exists—but it’s completely unrecognizable. Today, that structure looks like a stubby, UFO-like tower mushrooming from a concrete pedestal with a landscaped ramp curving upward. The metamorphosis is thanks to a multiyear project by New York architecture firm ODA. Ola Palermo, as the reimagined structure is known, has become a mixed-use building with cafés, restaurants, and Class A office space. The cherry on top of this (concrete) cake is an open-air promenade that peels off the sidewalk, winds up to what used to be the roof of the garage, blossoms into a rooftop park, then winds back down to the other side of the building. In a structure once defined by cars, the ramp is now be synonymous with people.[Photo: Alan Karchmer/courtesy ODA]To demolish or not to demolishODA (ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies of 2025 by Fast Company) has a history of working on adaptive reuse projects, including Detroit’s Book Tower and 10 Jay Street in Brooklyn, but when founder Eran Chen first heard about the project from real estate firm BSD Investments, it was presented to him as an empty site.The building, which had been vacant for years, sits on a tricky plot sandwiched between two busy roads and an elevated train line. It is very close to the edge of Tres de Febrero Park (also known as Bosques de Palermo, or Palermo Woods), but before ODA got involved the two were not connected. [Image: courtesy ODA]Before arriving on-site, Chen had considered demolishing the parking garage, but when he saw the building, the idea just clicked. “The building immediately captured my imagination,” Chen says, noting the first thing that surprised him was the structure’s ceiling height. Most parking garages have low ceilings, which makes them challenging to convert—this one had a 14- to 15-foot ceiling. (For perspective: Most homes have 8- to 9-foot ceilings.) The ceiling had a waffle design, which looks like a grid of intersecting beams that create a pattern of recessed squares. This helped distribute the weight of the ceiling evenly, allowing it to span large areas without the need for additional columns for support, and creating a more open and flexible space for the building’s use. [Photo: Alan Karchmer/courtesy ODA]To top it all off, the roof afforded a clear 360-degree view. On one side, you could see through Palermo Woods, all the way to downtown Buenos Aires. On the other, there’s a private racetrack and polo fields that people can visit only if they have exclusive memberships. “On one side you have the haves, and on the other, you have everybody else, and this is smack dab in between the two,” says Chen. He saw the rooftop as an opportunity to turn the tables and allow the park’s visitors to “look down” on the exclusive grounds and catch a (free) glimpse of any events that take place there.[Photo: Alan Karchmer/courtesy ODA]Form follows experiencesODA kept 80% of the original structure to create a 160,000-square-foot building. A quarter of this surface—about 40,000 square feet—is dedicated to public terraces, green spaces, and the open-air promenade. The rest is taken up by restaurants, cafés, and retail spaces. Parking for 250 cars is also available on the ground floor. But the program, or function, of the building wasn’t always clear. The area isn’t zoned for residential use, and commercial use wasn’t “the obvious choice,” says Chen, as most companies who could afford rent for a modern office building would opt for a space in downtown Buenos Aires. Retail, which thrives on heavy footfall, wasn’t obvious either since the site is so isolated and on the edge of the city.[Photo: Alan Karchmer/courtesy ODA]But for many years now, Chen has been honing a new mantra. “Form should not follow function anymore. Form should follow experiences,” he says. “If we design buildings for the human experience, people will visit these buildings—and enjoy them—regardless of the program.” In other words, build it and they will come? I ask. “Build it well and they will come,” he says. An important distinction. To turn the building into an irresistible destination, ODA made four incisions. They carved out one courtyard to let light into the widest part of the building, and shaved off slivers of the facade to make room for two sets of stairs and the ramp.These incisions amount to 20% of the floor area, but the architects didn’t lose that space; they redistributed it. At one end of the building, there once was a water tower that rose above the area’s height restrictions. The tower was obsolete, so Chen convinced the city to remove it. In its place, Chen’s team built a four-story tower “based on the memory of the water tower.” This “concrete mushroom” as he calls it, now rises above the rest of the structure, holding its most premium office spaces.[Photo: Alan Karchmer/courtesy ODA]A blueprint for the U.S.The resulting building is what Chen calls a “win-win-win.” It benefits city agencies because it makes a meaningful contribution to the public realm. It benefits the local community, which now has access to a public rooftop park. And it benefits the developer, who saved on construction costs (no new foundations were required) by not demolishing the building.It also benefits the environment, since giving buildings a second chance, as Chen puts it, can help lower the environmental footprint associated with building anew. (Though there could be costs associated with bringing an old building up to code.) “Cities are filled with structures that are either dated or unnecessary, and of course, a big chunk of it is parking garages,” Chen says.Already, architects are starting to build “future-proof” parking garages like this multistory car park in Calgary, Alberta, that was specifically designed to transform into a 600-person office or 50-unit residential building if (and when) the need arises. But Chen believes that residential and commercial are not the only options, especially if the building’s ceilings are low, as they often are. He includes indoor/outdoor sports venues, like pickleball courts; urban farms; and even open-air markets among the possibilities. “The key,” he says, “is not to be fixated on the obvious programs that people might think of.”",

    "title": "California now has more EV chargers than gas pumps—but it’s still not enough",
    "content": "As of this year, EV chargers now outnumber gas pumps in the state of California. The state has an estimated 178,000 shared chargers for electric cars—not counting another 700,000 private chargers that are installed in single-family homes, according to the California Energy Commission. That’s compared to roughly 120,000 gas pumps across the state. The number of EV chargers nearly doubled since 2023, though part of the increase came from identifying charging stations that hadn’t previously been counted. The official stats include both public chargers and those that are shared at workplaces or in apartment buildings. It’s still only a fraction of the number of chargers that are coming. By the most recent estimate, California will need around 1 million public and “shared private” chargers by 2030, enough to support the estimated 7 million light-duty electric vehicles that may be on the road by then. By 2035, when a rule requiring new vehicles to be electric will go into effect—the state could need more than 2 million shared EV chargers. (That&#8217;s assuming the rule survives Trump&#8217;s attempts to kill it.) For drivers who own a house with a garage, charging overnight at home can easily cover most needs. Still, those drivers obviously need access to public chargers for longer trips. And around 45% of Californians are renters who don’t have garages of their own. New building codes require new apartment buildings to make parking spaces EV ready, and also apply to existing parking spaces when older buildings are renovated or expanded. Renters also have the right to install chargers themselves when they have a designated parking space. The rules also require a certain number of parking spaces at motels and retail and commercial parking lots to be EV ready. &#8220;Retrofitting the existing stock of multifamily dwellings with chargers is a substantial challenge,&#8221; says Esther Conrad, a research manager at Stanford University who has studied the rollout of EV chargers. Charging EVs takes substantially longer than filling up with gas, which is the main reason so why more charging ports are needed than gas pumps—both in order to prevent bottlenecks at charging stations and because chargers are used in different places, from parking lots to street parking in cities. But as charging tech and vehicles improve, the total number of chargers that are needed is likely to shrink from current estimates, says Harrison Reilly, a spokesperson for the California Energy Commission. (In China, tech is already much farther ahead, with some new cars capable of charging in roughly as quickly as it takes to pump gas.) The state will publish a new estimate of charging needs later this year. For the moment, Reilly says, there are enough chargers to support the number of light-duty EVs that are on California roads. That&#8217;s a major milestone; with nearly 2 million electric cars and light-duty trucks, California also has more EVs than any other state. Last year, around 25% of all new car sales there were electric. Other states can learn from California&#8217;s policy. &#8220;First, states should be developing clear and ambitious EV targets, especially as the federal government pulls back on some of the targets for the transition,&#8221; says Jeff Prosserman, CEO and cofounder of Voltpost, a company that converts streetlights so they can double as curbside EV chargers. &#8220;They were leading the charge by looking to have as a mandate 100% of new car sales to be electric by 2035.&#8221; The state&#8217;s requirement for new apartment buildings to add EV chargers is critical. It has also provided important financial support, including grants to add chargers in disadvantaged neighborhoods, and has pushed to help streamline permitting so projects can be built faster. There are still obstacles as it moves forward. &#8220;One of the big challenges is the need for additional grid capacity to handle all of the charging,&#8221; says Conrad, though the state is trying to help address that. She says that even more funding is needed to add chargers in some locations where private developers might not otherwise build them. As the Trump administration tries to cancel promised support for EV chargers, it puts more financial pressure on the state. But the network is still quickly growing now. Voltpost, for example, is moving forward on a project to add curbside EV chargers in some neighborhoods in San Francisco. &#8220;It&#8217;s in no way impacted by federal policy—it&#8217;s state and city-driven,&#8221; says Prosserman. &#8220;From what we&#8217;ve seen at Voltpost, progressive states like California are going to continue providing funding opportunities to meet their climate targets with or without support from the federal government,&#8221; he says.",

    "title": "QVC, the original video shopping network, is pivoting to TikTok",
    "content": "QVC&#8217;s bringing its always-on home shopping network to a TikTok livestream near you. The company announced Wednesday that it would host nonstop shopping livestreams on the app, the first of their kind on TikTok in the U.S. and part of a strategic agreement with the video-sharing platform, which is itself facing a critical moment. Its once-delayed ban is looming. But broadcast TV shopping needs to pivot to survive, and QVC sees TikTok as one of the best avenues to do that. &#8220;QVC and HSN hosts have mastered live shopping moments for decades and we&#8217;re thrilled to bring this entertaining shopping experience to TikTok&#8217;s community,&#8221; TikTok Shop&#8217;s head of U.S. operations Nico Le Bourgeois said in a statement. QVC Group, which runs the home shopping channels QVC and HSN, launched on TikTok Shop in 2024, but 24/7 live social shopping experiences represent a deeper push onto the app just days before it could go offline. TikTok could again be banned in the U.S. on Saturday if it doesn&#8217;t find a new American owner. QVC Group says on television it reaches more than 200 million homes, but with live TV viewing in decline, it&#8217;s had to invest in other platforms to reach a new generation of shoppers. The company has its own QVC+ and HSN+ streaming services as well as accounts on social networking sites like TikTok, where it has nearly half a million followers. QVC says more than 74,000 creators on TikTok have featured their items in shoppable videos or livestreams since last August. In some sense, TikTok and QVC&#8217;s UX are completely synergistic. The partnership retrofits the live, long-form linear tv format that made QVC famous in a context that&#8217;s familiar with young people today: an endless feed of people hawking goods. (TikTok videos are a less bite-sized as it is: uploaded videos can be up to 60 minutes long.) The company claims that bringing its approach to sales on social at this scale will revolutionize the space. Citing its expertise putting on &#8220;large-scale, high-volume, live social shopping,&#8221; QVC Group president and CEO David Rawlinson II said in a statement the company will bring to the endeavor its lineup of celebrities, hosts, brands, and products. &#8220;Our agreement will be a catalyst to transform shopping and discovery, not only for QVC Group and TikTok Shop, but also for social shopping at large,&#8221; he said. But first, they have to break-even. QVC Group ended Q4 with an almost $1.3 billion operating loss, and ended its year with an 8% drop in total revenue. Social media companies have worked to grow their shopping capabilities, but social shopping hasn&#8217;t taken hold in the U.S. to the extent that it has in other countries. Social commerce accounted for nearly 30% of all e-commerce in China last year, compared to less than 6% in the U.S., according to data from eMarketer. If QVC can successfully translate its experience selling products on TV to a smaller screen, though, that figure could grow.",

    "title": "This small Montana town is the gateway to Yellowstone. Trump’s budget cuts could decimate it",
    "content": "On March 1, hundreds of people gathered in Gardiner, Montana, at the northern entrance to Yellowstone National Park. The crowd—which included residents from across the state and current and former public lands employees—was part of a nationwide protest against the layoffs of federal workers.&nbsp; Roughly 5% of National Park Service workers have been caught up in the sweeping layoffs carried out by Donald Trump’s administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. This isn’t counting the hundreds of others who are taking the “fork in the road” offer to resign from their positions. The staffing crisis facing national parks is felt not only within the federal workforce itself but also in gateway towns like Gardiner, where the economy depends heavily on Yellowstone.&nbsp; There, under the Roosevelt Arch—named for President Theodore Roosevelt, who laid its cornerstone and is known for preserving over 230 million acres of public land—protesters shouted chants like “Public lands in public hands!” and “Hey, ho, Trump and Musk have got to go.” Organizers talked about what public lands mean to the local economy. The crowd even harmonized to Woody Guthrie’s “This Land Is Your Land.” The chaos and uncertainties that have come with Trump’s executive actions reach all corners of the country and, as with the case of cutting funding to USAID, around the world. But Gardiner, perhaps like no other place, can be seen as an epicenter of loss following Trump’s decisions. Shutting down federal funding through the Park Service could cripple the town. Gardiner was established shortly after the park opened in 1872 to foster a symbiotic relationship that continues today. Yellowstone and Gardiner are inextricable. The western part of the town’s public high school is technically inside the park, with local businesses, the Gardiner community library, and the chamber of commerce building all abutting the park boundary. “Gardiner is a company town and Yellowstone is the mill,” said Richard Parks, who serves as the chair of the Gardiner Resort Area District. “If somebody starts screwing with the mill, we have no choice but to be concerned.” In 2023, Yellowstone hosted 4.5 million visitors, contributing an estimated $828 million and 8,560 jobs to surrounding townships like Gardiner. Industries like rafting, horseback riding, guiding, and hospitality services are all booming subeconomies that depend on tourism to the park. Yellowstone’s foot traffic also provides bedrock funding to town infrastructure and community development through its resort tax—a 3% charge on reservations during peak season, which has helped raise public dollars for things like updated water and sewer systems, bear-proof trash cans, and new fire engines.&nbsp; The full extent to which federal firings, hiring freezes, and funding cuts will ripple throughout communities like Gardiner is still unclear, Parks said. “We can’t gauge the magnitude yet.”&nbsp; With more than 60% of the area surrounding Gardiner controlled by federal land management agencies, deficits to entities like the National Park Service, or NPS, and U.S. Forest Service are felt acutely by the community.&nbsp; To Parks, the biggest question is whether Gardiner will have the traffic it needs to sustain itself this peak season. Removing hands, and expertise, from the entities that support and manage the park could degrade the experience for visitors, while news of the struggles could be enough to keep some travelers away entirely. “It’s like playing Whac-a-Mole,” said Parks. “The uncertainty is a massive problem because you just don’t know what kind of disaster to prepare for.” For Parks and other community members, the memory of 2022’s devastating flood stokes worst-case scenario fears for what life could be like without the driving economic force of the park. The flood washed out 3 miles of road from Gardiner into the park’s interior, severing the community from the park and barring public access for the entirety of peak season.&nbsp; The slew of cancellations from the park’s usual large volume of visitors caused cascading damages to locals who had already invested in the season. A study conducted after the flood found that communities like Gardiner whose park access was cut off lost 75% of their income on average. The findings, corroborated by a survey of townspeople, indicated that the flood exceeded the economic losses from the COVID-19 shutdown two years prior, resulting in a net loss of $156 million.&nbsp; Cara McGary, a local wildlife guide who has been in Gardiner for over 10 years, said the flood significantly impacted her business. Now she is trepidatious about the money she has invested in permits and bookings for the upcoming season. “In Gardiner, everyone in some way is directly or indirectly dependent on the NPS,” said McGary. “I need federal workers on federal lands for my business to function.” McGary also underscored trickle-down effects that occur when the community is cut off from the park, like during the 2022 flood and another partial closure in 2018 and 2019 due to the 35-day government shutdown. Lack of access meant a lack of attendance to basic public lands infrastructure, leading to what McGary called a “shituation,” evoking scenes of overflowing pit toilets and trashed campgrounds. When that happened, volunteers throughout the community pitched in to maintain the integrity of the park that is their bread and butter. “Having a love for this place, whether that is working the land as a producer, ranger, hunter, visitor, or hiker—it’s a value you can’t put money on,” said McGary. “This place is held together by people who give a damn and everyone plays a critical role.” Disasters like that 500-year flood won’t be so few and far between in the future, according to a Greater Yellowstone Climate Assessment led by researchers at Montana State University, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the University of Wyoming. The assessment was a first of its kind focusing on climate change impacts on the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.&nbsp; Cathy Whitlock, a co-author of the report, emphasized the ways in which climate change and its impacts will influence Yellowstone in years to come. She highlighted the increasing likelihood of high-profile disasters, but also the more gradual changes that could disrupt the ecosystem balance. “In Yellowstone, projected changes are largely driven by rising temperatures and the reduction in snowpack,” she said. “Current trends including warming, less snow, more rain, earlier snowmelt, and drier summers are expected to continue.” According to Whitlock, every resource management decision for Yellowstone should consider the potential effects of climate change. The park’s vegetation, lakes, streams, fish, and wildlife are all vulnerable.&nbsp; “The ecosystem will continue to experience climate change no matter who is in the White House. But our ability to monitor, adapt, and plan for environmental consequences will be at risk without sustained funding,” Whitlock said. On March 20, Mike Tranel, deputy superintendent for Yellowstone, gave an updated forecast for the season to the Gardiner Chamber of Commerce. He highlighted concerns over staffing, with layoffs resulting in a shortage of equipment operators, and people taking severance package offers leading to delays in hiring seasonal positions like entrance station workers. “Those are key people,” said Tranel. “The positions pay for themselves.” Although he did not specify, he also noted that the federal workforce reduction would likely cause effects behind the scenes, especially pertaining to scientific work on species like bears and wolves. Tranel said that the park was getting its full complement of seasonal workers, however—an exception to the current federal hiring freeze—and that the NPS remains confident it can pull off the upcoming peak season.“We will do our best with the circumstances for the 4.75 million visitors,” Tranel said.&nbsp; Tourism to Yellowstone typically starts in March for the north entrance and ramps up by mid-April, when the west entrance road into the park opens. So far, Gardiner is experiencing a worrisome start, according to Chester Evitt, the owner of Mama Bear’s Armory, a local gunsmith and outdoor gear shop. Evitt said he has had only a handful of customers since January, forcing him to use his disability checks from his time as a combat veteran to pay the shop rent. Evitt said that he and his family voted for Trump, but if he could take his vote back now he would. “I’ve been alive for 11 presidents and I haven’t seen one that has been as destructive as this one,” said Evitt. “These cuts are affecting our little town more than the 500-year flood.” Evitt said that he tried to go to the local bank to get a loan to help him make it to May, but when he arrived, there were several other business owners there for the same reason. The bank told all of them that it couldn’t offer any monetary assistance until things were more certain.&nbsp; Back at the Roosevelt Arch, three weeks after the first protest, a committed band of locals again gathered to make their voices heard—this time braving sheets of wet snow and 30 mph winds. Richard Midgette, one of the protest organizers, was recently hired back as an IT specialist for Yellowstone after being let go as part of the probationary firings. But he remains frustrated and fearful, as NPS employees anticipate further payroll cuts. Meanwhile, as Gardiner begins to wake up this spring, locals say they are open and ready for the season. The community is working diligently to navigate the chaos handed down to them from afar the best way they know how—continuing to serve in the best interest of the park whose vitality is so closely tied to their own. “It’s not about the money, it’s about the community’s psyche,” said Evitt. “We’re hoping that despite the odds, we can survive.” —&nbsp;Emily Senkosky, Grist This article originally appeared in Grist, a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.

    "title": "How to drive performance without playing the blame game",
    "content": "In today’s turbulent economic climate, there’s an intense pressure to perform. Organizations are exploring new business models and ways of working to accelerate growth and stay competitive. Boards and shareholders demand results, which pushes leadership teams to dial up their expectations. The term “accountability” has become a buzzword in discussions, but far too many misunderstand and misapply it. When leaders talk about&nbsp;creating a culture of accountability, they often rely on “shame and blame” tactics. This approach might seem effective in the short term, but it ultimately undermines the culture leaders seek to build. Instead of motivating individuals to do more, it drives people to hide from responsibility. Redefining accountability The challenge is redefining accountability. How do you set clear, high-performance expectations and hold people to them without sliding into the counterproductive cycle of shaming and blaming? To create a culture of accountability that truly enhances performance, leaders need to think about accountability differently. That means moving away from coercion and blame to mutual responsibility and ownership, which empowers individuals to own their roles and contribute to the team’s success. Consider the case of a manufacturing company I worked with. Facing stiff competition and the need to innovate quickly, the company’s executive team realized that the old ways of operating were no longer sufficient. Its traditional approach to accountability was stifling innovation and preventing the company from adapting to new market realities. The culture had to change from blame-focused to one where everyone—from the top down—felt invested in the company’s success and comfortable owning both their wins and their mistakes. Leadership needed to break down accountability into the distinct behaviors they wanted to see: identifying the issues, claiming the issues as your own, and changing the outcomes. This approach made the change real and enabled leaders to work collaboratively to implement the new culture. Here’s how: 1. Identify the issues: proactively ask for understanding The first step to building accountability in the company was for leaders to help their teams see issues before they escalate. They brought this to life through scaled leader sprints, which were focused, short-term initiatives designed to instill key habits across the organization. This practice encouraged leaders to seek feedback from their teams and peers, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and&nbsp;transparency&nbsp;when team members felt safe to speak up. Leaders also practiced how to pause before reacting to bad news. The simple act of taking a moment to consider the best response helped them approach problems with a clear mind, avoiding knee-jerk reactions that might discourage team members from raising concerns. Lastly, this practice also taught leaders to invite perspectives by asking, “How do you see it?” rather than the more typical “What do you think?” This promoted open dialogue and the consideration of multiple viewpoints to understand the same problem. By cultivating these habits, the company’s leaders focused more on inquiry, shifting active problem-solving to a collaborative process with the team. 2. Claim the issues as your own: embrace the outcomes The second part of accountability for the company was about taking actions that delivered the most critical business outcomes. The company needed to train leaders to prioritize initiatives that had the highest impact on these goals, avoiding the trap of rewarding “busy work” that appeared productive but didn’t contribute to organizational objectives. Leaders practiced skills to evaluate their initiatives to concentrate on high-leverage actions—those that would generate the most significant results with the least amount of wasted effort. That means setting the example of refocusing themselves on impactful actions (while stopping those that were mere activity) and then deliberately taking time in team meetings to review and reassess priorities. As a result, the leaders were able to develop a new muscle in themselves and their teams. The clarity on prioritizing the right actions over simply working harder energized the organization to continue to make the change. &nbsp; 3. Change the outcomes: measure and adapt The company focused on evolving its key performance metrics to support these new priority outcomes. Leadership realized that if they tried to change behavior, yet continued to measure the same old actions, the change wouldn’t stick. The company also needed to shift these key performance metrics to reflect what’s more important or impactful as business priorities evolved, which required more flexibility and transparency from the leaders. In this phase, the leaders moved to create a new dashboard, identifying the core metrics they were trying to accomplish that would tell them if they were moving the needle in response to competitive threats. They agreed to review the data quarterly and share what they learned with the organization. When the metrics moved in the right direction, there was a public celebration of the progress. And perhaps more importantly, when they didn’t, the leaders engaged their teams in ideating how to adapt their actions—and what they were measuring—rather than placing blame.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new habits practiced in these three phases created visible early momentum, as the aura of “shame and blame” noticeably lifted.&nbsp;One team, for example, reduced the time that it took to get product updates to market. Their rapid prototyping test-review-fail program allowed them to experiment quickly, share learnings at weekly meetings, and fail without fear of reprisal.&nbsp;By shifting away from traditional views of accountability and embracing a more collaborative and trust-based approach, you can help your team achieve the high performance that current market conditions demand.",

    "title": "How a multi-generational C-suite can future-proof your business",
    "content": "In HBO’s hit show&nbsp;Succession, patriarch Logan Roy pitted his children against each other for the top spot of leading his media conglomerate. Those who’ve seen the show will know how it ends, but what if he took a different route? What if he established a collaborative, multi-generational leadership team to guide Waystar RoyCo into the future? Granted, it&nbsp;would have made for far less dramatic tension (and probably fewer award wins) for the show.&nbsp;But for Roy’s shareholders, it would’ve been a smarter move in a rapidly changing media industry. Succession planning is a non-negotiable principle for any thriving organization, yet it’s also one of the hardest to get right. And in today’s volatile, fast-changing environment, proactive planning is even more critical. There are relentless technological disruptions, and&nbsp;diversity initiatives&nbsp;are under scrutiny. For the first time in history, five generations will work side-by-side in offices around the world. These dynamics present unique challenges for maintaining growth and stability. For CEOs, whose average age is 59, the following questions are critical: Are they equipped to&nbsp;engage Gen Z employees&nbsp;and the subsequent generation? Are they prepared to lead in an AI-driven world? Without support, the honest answer is often no. Last year, the Financial Times reported that a&nbsp;record number&nbsp;of CEOs stepped down due to investor pressures, technological disruptions, and underperforming markets. All of these factors are making the role harder than ever. After years of thought, I recently decided to appoint a new CEO for our U.K. and European business. It was a bold move as we skipped a few generations. But he was ready to take the reins after a lot of training, learning, and success. So far, it’s working. In a very short period, our business already feels more energized, agile, innovative, and resilient. Here’s how you can create the same momentum for your business. Build an open culture of multi-generational learning By the time Generation Alpha enters the workforce,&nbsp;five generations will be working together&nbsp;in a single workplace. Rather than seeing this as a challenge, treat it as an opportunity. Harnessing multi-generational perspectives fosters creativity, improves decision-making, and strengthens collaboration across teams. To align generational differences, encourage multi-generational open learning. For example, you could introduce mentoring schemes that encourage a two-way flow of ideas and perspectives between senior and junior staff, rather than solely top-down programs. Balancing continuity with the pursuit of innovation is the leadership challenge of our times. A multi-CEO model with&nbsp;age diversity&nbsp;might just be the way to navigate it. A diverse suite of leaders can help bridge the gaps between generations because it creates a synergy that benefits employees, clients, and organizational growth. Identify and support the right successors from each generation Finding qualified leaders has always been a challenge, and today’s hyper-disruptive business environment has only made it more difficult. From tech to media, industries undergoing transformation need leaders who can navigate complexity and disruption, even though it may be the first time they’ve done it. You might be wondering whether you should promote internally or hire from the outside. My view is clear, and it’s that home-grown works best. I’ve tried both, and in our type of business, growing a successor over time always seems to work better than bringing in someone from outside. Once you’ve identified a potential successor, help them rise with a development plan that gets them to the top job. They’ll have plenty of opportunities to succeed and fail along the way. By observing how they handle these moments, you build confidence in your choice. Just be aware that high-performing employees will have their choice of job offers, so you need to figure out how you can incentivize them to stay. Twice, I’ve developed successors only to have them leave for competitors. Losing these experts can be costly and immensely frustrating. &nbsp; A multi-generational C-suite acts as a safety net, retaining these individuals while equipping them with the tools and mentorship they need to continue excelling. Act now to prepare for the future The best time to think about your succession strategy is now. Tomorrow’s leaders need opportunities to observe, contribute, and think collectively about the decisions, products, and services that will define your organization in three to five years. Invite emerging leaders to share their opinions and take on increased responsibility. Encourage them to collaborate across generations. By empowering future leaders today, you foster innovation and resilience for the years ahead. Succession wasn’t just the heart of a TV drama; it’s a real-life leadership challenge. For business owners, Logan Roy’s missteps offer a cautionary tale. Procrastination and neglecting to nurture a diverse pool of future leaders are risks that no organization can afford. A multi-generational leadership pipeline isn’t just an asset; it’s a necessity in an environment defined by rapid transformation and complexity. Developing new leaders while leveraging the expertise of seasoned executives positions your business to weather disruptions and capitalize on opportunities. Don’t wait. Start building a forward-thinking succession strategy today and ensure that your organization is ready for tomorrow’s challenges. A dynamic, multi-generational C-suite can secure your place as a disruptor, not the disrupted.",

    "title": "This Passover staple is now hard to find in Canada, and Trump’s tariffs are to blame",
    "content": "For Jews in Canada, much like their American counterparts, Manischewitz kosher wine has become a staple of Passover and other religious celebrations. But now many are struggling to find the New York state-made drink for the wine-heavy spring holiday as Canadian government retailers and wholesale monopolies pull American-made products from shelves in protest of U.S. President Donald Trump&#8216;s tariffs and annexation threats. The missing wine illustrates how Trump&#8217;s instigation of a trade war with Canada and his bellicose talk is causing pain for Canadian consumers and U.S. beverage companies like Manischewitz owner E & J Gallo Winery, as well as potential opportunities for Canadian competitors. Many Canadian consumers are embracing a &#8220;Buy Canadian&#8221; movement and avoiding U.S.-made goods, but for some specialized products like sweet and fruity Manischewitz kosher wine, there is no true alternative, kosher goods retailers and consumers say. Canada&#8217;s provincial governments control liquor sales and wholesaling, and since early March have all banned U.S. alcohol imports as well as most distribution and sales, including Manischewitz wine and Jack Daniels bourbon whiskey. Existing stocks have been yanked from shelves across the sprawling nation. Private stores, allowed to sell existing supplies, told Reuters their Manischewitz bottles were snapped up by shoppers soon after the provincial governments&#8217; bans were announced. &#8220;People are freaking out,&#8221; said Louise Waldman, a Winnipeg Jew who associates the particular taste of Manischewitz wine with a lifetime of Passover meals. Manischewitz and Gallo did not respond to requests for comment. During Passover, which begins on April 12, Jews gather for traditional meals, called seders, and eat specific foods including horseradish, parsley and eggs. Traditionally, each participant drinks four glasses of wine throughout the meal. Aaron Bernstein of family-owned Bernstein&#8217;s Delicatessen, a Jewish food store and restaurant in Winnipeg in Western Canada, said he has had to tell patriotic Canadian shoppers that there are not domestically made versions of some kosher products. &#8220;There&#8217;s no other product like Manischewitz wine,&#8221; he said. Made kosher in Canada Canadian Jews seeking kosher wine to fulfill the ceremonial obligation might still find some Israeli wine in some government-operated liquor stores. Manitoba Liquor Marts offer three kosher wines, such as both red and white from the Galil Mountain Winery, a spokesperson said. But for some kosher foods producers in Canada, the upsurge in patriotic pride and the desire for &#8220;Made in Canada&#8221; goods is a chance to expand business. Ritesh Patel, the director of operations for Elman&#8217;s Food Products, a Winnipeg kosher foods processor since 1938, hopes to capture more of the domestic kosher market. The company is in talks with major national chains about carrying their pickled products like sauerkraut, eggs and horseradish, he said. To replace some American products, Bernstein said his deli has been ordering more products from Israel, but imports take longer to arrive because of the extended supply chain. For some Canadian Jews who keep kosher, the concern goes beyond missing holiday foods and extends to the risk of tariffs and higher prices on other staple products making groceries unaffordable. &#8220;We&#8217;re very concerned in general. The price of food is astronomical and the price of kosher food is even more concerning,&#8221; said Richard Rabkin, the managing director of the Kashruth Council of Canada, the country&#8217;s largest kosher certification agency. —Ed White and Leah Douglas, Reuters",

    "title": "TSLA roller-coaster ride: Tesla sees largest-ever drop in vehicle deliveries, but report says Musk could leave DOGE",
    "content": "On Wednesday, Tesla reported its largest drop in delivery numbers to date, and a 13% drop in sales since the beginning of the year, in part due to backlash against CEO Elon Musk&#8217;s role in the U.S. government, coupled with growing competition in the EV market. However, by midday, shares of the EV maker started moving higher following an unconfirmed&nbsp;Politico report&nbsp;that Musk may soon step away from his role in the Trump administration. That report said Trump insiders and allies have become increasingly &#8220;frustrated with his unpredictability&#8221; and see him as a &#8220;political liability.&#8221; But the retreat is also likely the result of the hit his businesses have taken. Here’s what to know about the latest Tesla delivery numbers and sales, as well as how the company’s stock is doing today. Tesla first-quarter sales and delivery numbers plummet A look at the numbers shows Tesla posted its worst sales in nearly three years. It delivered 336,681 cars in the first quarter, down from 387,000 in the first three months of 2024 and less than in any period since the second quarter of 2022. The EV maker missed analyst estimates of as low as 350,000 vehicles. Analysts had predicted lower sales following poor European numbers and because Tesla temporarily closed some factories to update the new Model Y. On Tuesday,&nbsp;Electrek reported&nbsp;Tesla has $200 million worth of unsold Cybertrucks sitting in its inventory. Tesla sales in Europe and China are down Wednesday&#8217;s sales report follows data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, which confirms Tesla sales fell 49% in Europe in the first two months of the quarter, despite the fact that overall EV sales in Europe were up 28%, pointing to a loss of the electric vehicle market share. Another reason for the drop can be attributed to European Tesla boycotts over Musk&#8217;s controversial political views, including his support for Europe&#8217;s far-right parties. Yet, Europe isn&#8217;t the largest market for electric vehicles, China is. China is also Tesla&#8217;s second-largest market after the U.S., where it now faces growing competition from other EV automakers. Chinese automaker BYD&nbsp;reported sales of more than 416,000 fully electric passenger vehicles in the quarter, up 39% from the previous year, overtaking Tesla as the world’s largest seller of EVs. What does this mean for TSLA stock? Shares of Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) fell about 2% in early trading and are now up about 4% in midday trading at the time of this writing, due in part to that Politico report that Musk may be soon moving on from the White House. While Tesla stock started the year strong, and nearly doubled after the presidential election, it has lost 44% since December&#8217;s all-time high. In 2025, the stock is down over 35% year to date, taking a major hit due to the Musk backlash, including protests at Tesla dealerships in the form of Tesla Takedowns. A&nbsp;recent CNN poll&nbsp;found 53% of Americans rate Musk negatively, with only 35% giving him a positive rating, making him even more unpopular than Vice President JD Vance (who has a 44% unfavorable rating).",

    "title": "We should talk more about air-conditioning",
    "content": "Things are starting to warm up here in the New York City area, and it’s got me thinking once again about something that people aren’t talking about enough: energy demand for air conditioners. \n\nI get it: Data centers are the shiny new thing to worry about. And I’m not saying we shouldn’t be thinking about the strain that gigawatt-scale computing installations put on the grid. But a little bit of perspective is important here.\n\nAccording to a report from the International Energy Agency last year, data centers will make up less than 10% of the increase in energy demand between now and 2030, far less than the energy demand from space cooling (mostly air-conditioning).\n\nI just finished up a new story that’s out today about a novel way to make heat exchangers, a crucial component in air conditioners and a whole host of other technologies that cool our buildings, food, and electronics. Let’s dig into why I’m writing about the guts of cooling technologies, and why this sector really needs innovation. \n\nOne twisted thing about cooling and climate change: It’s all a vicious cycle. As temperatures rise, the need for cooling technologies increases. In turn, more fossil-fuel power plants are firing up to meet that demand, turning up the temperature of the planet in the process.\n\n“Cooling degree days” are one measure of the need for additional cooling. Basically, you take a preset baseline temperature and figure out how much the temperature exceeds it. Say the baseline (above which you’d likely need to flip on a cooling device) is 21 °C (70 °F). If the average temperature for a day is 26 °C, that’s five cooling degree days on a single day. Repeat that every day for a month, and you wind up with 150 cooling degree days.\n\nI explain this arguably weird metric because it’s a good measure of total energy demand for cooling—it lumps together both how many hot days there are and just how hot it is. \n\nAnd the number of cooling degree days is steadily ticking up globally. Global cooling degree days were 6% higher in 2024 than in 2023, and 20% higher than the long-term average for the first two decades of the century. Regions that have high cooling demand, like China, India, and the US, were particularly affected, according to the IEA report. You can see a month-by-month breakdown of this data from the IEA here.\n\nThat increase in cooling degree days is leading to more demand for air conditioners, and for energy to power them. Air-conditioning accounted for 7% of the world’s electricity demand in 2022, and it’s only going to get more important from here.\n\nThere were fewer than 2 billion AC units in the world in 2016. By 2050, that could be nearly 6 billion, according to a 2018 report from the IEA. This is a measure of progress and, in a way, something we should be happy about; the number of air conditioners tends to rise with household income. But it does present a challenge to the grid.  \n\nAnother piece of this whole thing: It’s not just about how much total electricity we need to run air conditioners but about when that demand tends to come. As we’ve covered in this newsletter before, your air-conditioning habits aren’t unique. Cooling devices tend to flip on around the same time—when it’s hot. In some parts of the US, for example, air conditioners can represent more than 70% of residential energy demand at times when the grid is most stressed.\n\nThe good news is that we’re seeing innovations in cooling technology. Some companies are building cooling systems that include an energy storage component, so they can charge up when energy is plentiful and demand is low. Then they can start cooling when it’s most needed, without sucking as much energy from the grid during peak hours.\n\nWe’ve also covered alternatives to air conditioners called desiccant cooling systems, which use special moisture-sucking materials to help cool spaces and deal with humidity more efficiently than standard options.\n\nAnd in my latest story, I dug into new developments in heat exchanger technology. Heat exchangers are a crucial component of air conditioners, but you can really find them everywhere—in heat pumps, refrigerators, and, yes, the cooling systems in large buildings and large electronics installations, including data centers.\n\nWe’ve been building heat exchangers basically the same way for nearly a century. These components basically move heat around, and there are a few known ways to do so with devices that are relatively straightforward to manufacture. Now, though, one team of researchers has 3D-printed a heat exchanger that outperforms some standard designs and rivals others. This is still a long way from solving our looming air-conditioning crisis, but the details are fascinating—I hope you’ll give it a read. \n\nWe need more innovation in cooling technology to help meet global demand efficiently so we don’t stay stuck in this cycle. And we’ll need policy and public support to make sure that these technologies make a difference and that everyone has access to them too. \n\nThis article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review’s weekly climate newsletter.

    "title": "Rivals are rising to challenge the dominance of SpaceX",
    "content": "SpaceX is a space launch juggernaut. In just two decades, the company has managed to edge out former aerospace heavyweights Boeing, Lockheed, and Northrop Grumman to gain near-monopoly status over rocket launches in the US; it accounted for 87% of the country’s orbital launches in 2024, according to an analysis by SpaceNews. Since the mid-2010s, the company has dominated NASA’s launch contracts and become a major Pentagon contractor. It is now also the go-to launch provider for commercial customers, having lofted numerous satellites and five private crewed spaceflights, with more to come. \n\nOther space companies have been scrambling to compete for years, but developing a reliable rocket takes slow, steady work and big budgets. Now at least some of them are catching up. \n\nA host of companies have readied rockets that are comparable to SpaceX’s main launch vehicles. The list includes Rocket Lab, which aims to take on SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9 with its Neutron rocket and could have its first launch in late 2025, and Blue Origin, owned by Jeff Bezos, which recently completed the first mission of a rocket it hopes will compete against SpaceX’s Starship. \n\nSome of these competitors are just starting to get rockets off the ground. And the companies could also face unusual headwinds, given that SpaceX’s Elon Musk has an especially close relationship with the Trump administration and has allies at federal regulatory agencies, including those that provide oversight of the industry.\n\nBut if all goes well, the SpaceX challengers can help improve access to space and prevent bottlenecks if one company experiences a setback. “More players in the market is good for competition,” says Chris Combs, an aerospace engineer at the University of Texas at San Antonio. “I think for the foreseeable future it will still be hard to compete with SpaceX on price.” But, he says, the competitors could push SpaceX itself to become better and provide those seeking access to space with a wider array of options..\n\nA big lift\n\nThere are a few reasons why SpaceX was able to cement its position in the space industry. When it began in the 2000s, it had three consecutive rocket failures and seemed poised to fold. But it barreled through with Musk’s financial support, and later with a series of NASA and defense contracts. It has been a primary beneficiary of NASA’s commercial space program, developed in the 2010s with the intention of propping up the industry. \n\n“They got government contracts from the very beginning,” says Victoria Samson, a space policy expert at the Secure World Foundation in Broomfield, Colorado. “I wouldn’t say it’s a handout, but SpaceX would not exist without a huge influx of repeated government contracts. To this day, they’re still dependent on government customers, though they have commercial customers too.”\n\nSpaceX has also effectively achieved a high degree of vertical integration, Samson points out: It owns almost all parts of its supply chain, designing, building, and testing all its major hardware components in-house, with a minimal use of suppliers. That gives it not just control over its hardware but considerably lower costs, and the price tag is the top consideration for launch contracts. \n\nThe company was also open to taking risks other industry stalwarts were not. “I think for a very long time the industry looked at spaceflight as something that had to be very precise and perfect, and not a lot of room for tinkering,” says Combs. “SpaceX really was willing to take some risks and accept failure in ways that others haven’t been. That’s easier to do when you’re backed by a billionaire.” \n\nWhat’s finally enabled international and US-based competitors to emerge has been a growing customer base looking for launch services, along with some investors’ deep pockets. \n\nSome of these companies are taking aim at SpaceX’s Falcon 9, which can lift as much as about 20,000 kilograms into orbit and is used for sending multiple satellites or the crewed Dragon into space. “There is a practical monopoly in the medium-lift launch market right now, with really only one operational vehicle,” says Murielle Baker, a spokesperson for Rocket Lab, a US-New Zealand company.\n\nRocket Lab plans to take on the Falcon 9 with its Neutron rocket, which is expected to have its inaugural flight later this year from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. The effort is building on the success of the company’s smaller Electron rocket, and Neutron’s first stage is intended to be reusable after it parachutes down to the ocean. \n\nAnother challenger is Texas-based Firefly, whose Alpha rocket can be launched from multiple spaceports so that it can reach different orbits. Firefly has already secured NASA and Space Force contracts, with more launches coming this year (and on March 2 it also became the second private company to successfully land a spacecraft on the moon). Next year, Relativity Space aims to loft its first Terran R rocket, which is partially built from 3D-printed components. And the Bill Gates–backed Stoke Space aims to launch its reusable Nova rocket in late 2025 or, more likely, next year.\n\nCompetitors are also rising for SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, holding out the prospect of more options for sending massive payloads to higher orbits and deep space. Furthest along is the Vulcan Centaur rocket, a creation of United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. It’s expected to have its third and fourth launches in the coming months, delivering Space Force satellites to orbit. Powered by engines from Blue Origin, the Vulcan Centaur is slightly wider and shorter than the Falcon rockets. It currently isn’t reusable, but it’s less expensive than its predecessors, ULA’s Atlas V and Delta IV, which are being phased out. \n\nMark Peller, the company’s senior vice president on Vulcan development and advanced programs, says the new rocket comes with multiple advantages. “One is overall value, in terms of dollars per pound to orbit and what we can provide to our customers,” he says, “and the second is versatility: Vulcan was designed to go to a range of orbits.” He says more than 80 missions are already lined up. \n\nVulcan’s fifth flight, slated for no earlier than May, will launch the long-awaited Sierra Space Dream Chaser, a spaceplane that can carry cargo (and possibly crew) to the International Space Station. ULA also has upcoming Vulcan launches planned for Amazon’s Kuiper satellite constellation, a potential Starlink rival.\n\nMeanwhile, though it took a few years, Blue Origin now has a truly orbital heavy-lift spacecraft: In January, it celebrated the inaugural launch of its towering New Glenn, a rocket that’s only a bit shorter than NASA’s Space Launch System and SpaceX’s Starship. Future flights could launch national security payloads. \n\nCompetition is emerging abroad as well. After repeated delays, Europe’s heavy-lift Ariane 6, from Airbus subsidiary Arianespace, had its inaugural flight last year, ending the European Space Agency’s temporary dependence on SpaceX. A range of other companies are trying to expand European launch capacity, with assistance from ESA.\n\nChina is moving quickly on its own launch organizations too. “They had no less than seven ‘commercial’ space launch companies that were all racing to develop an effective system that could deliver a payload into orbit,” Kari Bingen, director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says of China’s efforts. “They are moving fast and they have capital behind them, and they will absolutely be a competitor on the global market once they’re successful and probably undercut what US and European launch companies are doing.” The up-and-coming Chinese launchers include Space Pioneer’s reusable Tianlong-3 rocket and Cosmoleap’s Yueqian rocket. The latter is to feature a “chopstick clamp” recovery of the first stage, where it’s grabbed by the launch tower’s mechanical arms, similar to the concept SpaceX is testing for its Starship.\n\nGlitches and government\n\nBefore SpaceX’s rivals can really compete, they need to work out the kinks, demonstrate the reliability of their new spacecraft, and show that they can deliver low-cost launch services to customers. \n\nThe process is not without its challenges. Boeing’s Starliner delivered astronauts to the ISS on its first crewed flight in June 2024, but after thruster malfunctions, they were left stranded at the orbital outpost for nine months. While New Glenn reached orbit as planned, its first stage didn’t land successfully and its upper stage was left in orbit. \n\nSpaceX itself has had some recent struggles. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded the Falcon 9 more than once following malfunctions in the second half of 2024. The company still shattered records last year, though, with more than 130 Falcon 9 launches. It has continued with that record pace this year, despite additional Falcon 9 delays and more glitches with its booster and upper stage. SpaceX also conducted its eighth Starship test flight in March, just two months after the previous one, but both failed minutes after liftoff, raining debris down from the sky.\n\nAny company must deal with financial challenges as well as engineering ones. Boeing is reportedly considering selling parts of its space business, following Starliner’s malfunctions and problems with its 737 Max aircraft. And Virgin Orbit, the launch company that spun off from Virgin Galactic, shuttered in 2023.\n\nAnother issue facing would-be commercial competitors to SpaceX in the US is the complex and uncertain political environment. Musk does not manage day-to-day operations of the company. But he has close involvement with DOGE, a Trump administration initiative that has been exerting influence on the workforces and budgets of NASA, the Defense Department, and regulators relevant to the space industry. \n\nJared Isaacman, a billionaire who bankrolled the groundbreaking 2021 commercial mission Inspiration4, returned to orbit, again via a SpaceX craft, on Polaris Dawn last September. Now he may become Trump’s NASA chief, a position that could give him the power to nudge NASA toward awarding new lucrative contracts to SpaceX. In February it was reported that SpaceX’s Starlink might land a multibillion-dollar FAA contract previously awarded to Verizon. \n\nIt is also possible that SpaceX could strengthen its position with respect to the regulatory scrutiny it has faced for environmental and safety issues at its production and launch sites on the coasts of Texas and Florida, as well as scrutiny of its rocket crashes and the resulting space debris. Oversight from the FAA, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Environmental Protection Agency may be weak. Conflicts of interest have already emerged at the FAA, and the Trump administration has also attempted to incapacitate the National Labor Relations Board. SpaceX had previously tried to block the board from acting after nine workers accused the company of unfair labor practices.\n\nSpaceX did not respond to MIT Technology Review’s requests for comment for this story.\n\n“I think there’s going to be a lot of emphasis to relieve a lot of the regulations, in terms of environmental impact studies, and things like that,” Samson says. “I thought there’d be a separation between [Musk’s] interests, but now, it’s hard to say where he stops and the US government begins.”\n\nRegardless of the politics, the commercial competition will surely heat up throughout 2025. But SpaceX has a considerable head start, Bingen argues: “It’s going to take a lot for these companies to effectively compete and potentially dislodge SpaceX, given the dominant position that [it has] had.”\n\nRamin Skibba is an astrophysicist turned science writer and freelance journalist, based in the Bay Are",

    "title": "The machines are rising — but developers still hold the keys",
    "content": "Rumors of the ongoing death of software development — that it’s being slain by AI — are greatly exaggerated. In reality, software development is at a fork in the road: embracing the (currently) far-off notion of fully automated software development or acknowledging the work of a software developer is much more than just writing lines of code.\n\nThe decision the industry makes could have significant long-term consequences. Increasing complacency around AI-generated code and a shift to what has been termed “vibe coding” — where code is generated through natural language prompts until the results seem to work — will lead to code that’s more error-strewn, more expensive to run and harder to change in the future. And, if the devaluation of software development skills continues, we may even lack a workforce with the skills and knowledge to fix things down the line. \n\nThis means software developers are going to become more important to how the world builds and maintains software. Yes, there are many ways their practices will evolve thanks to AI coding assistance, but in a world of proliferating machine-generated code, developer judgment and experience will be vital.\n\nThe dangers of AI-generated code are already here\n\nThe risks of AI-generated code aren’t science fiction: they’re with us today. Research done by GitClear earlier this year indicates that with AI coding assistants (like GitHub Copilot) going mainstream, code churn — which GitClear defines as “changes that were either incomplete or erroneous when the author initially wrote, committed, and pushed them to the company’s git repo&#8221; — has significantly increased. GitClear also found there was a marked decrease in the number of lines of code that have been moved, a signal for refactored code (essentially the care and feeding to make it more effective).\n\nIn other words, from the time coding assistants were introduced there’s been a pronounced increase in lines of code without a commensurate increase in lines deleted, updated, or replaced. Simultaneously, there&#8217;s been a decrease in lines moved — indicating a lot of code has been written but not refactored. More code isn’t necessarily a good thing (sometimes quite the opposite); GitClear’s findings ultimately point to complacency and a lack of rigor about code quality.\n\nCan AI be removed from software development?\n\nHowever, AI doesn’t have to be removed from software development and delivery. On the contrary, there’s plenty to be excited about. As noted in the latest volume of the Technology Radar — Thoughtworks’ report on technologies and practices from work with hundreds of clients all over the world — the coding assistance space is full of opportunities. \n\nSpecifically, the report noted tools like Cursor, Cline and Windsurf can enable software engineering agents. What this looks like in practice is an agent-like feature inside developer environments that developers can ask specific sets of coding tasks to be performed in the form of a natural language prompt. This enables the human/machine partnership.\n\nThat being said, to only focus on code generation is to miss the variety of ways AI can help software developers. For example, Thoughtworks has been interested in how generative AI can be used to understand legacy codebases, and we see a lot of promise in tools like Unblocked, which is an AI team assistant that helps teams do just that. In fact, Anthropic’s Claude Code helped us add support for new languages in an internal tool, CodeConcise. We use CodeConcise to understand legacy systems; and while our success was mixed, we do think there’s real promise here.\n\nTightening practices to better leverage AI\n\nIt’s important to remember much of the work developers do isn’t developing something new from scratch. A large proportion of their work is evolving and adapting existing (and sometimes legacy) software. Sprawling and janky code bases that have taken on technical debt are, unfortunately, the norm. Simply applying AI will likely make things worse, not better, especially with approaches like vibe. \n\nThis is why developer judgment will become more critical than ever. In the latest edition of the Technology Radar report, AI-friendly code design is highlighted, based on our experience that AI coding assistants perform best with well-structured codebases. \n\nIn practice, this requires many different things, including clear and expressive naming to ensure context is clearly communicated (essential for code maintenance), reducing duplicate code, and ensuring modularity and effective abstractions. Done together, these will all help make code more legible to AI systems.\n\nGood coding practices are all too easy to overlook when productivity and effectiveness are measured purely in terms of output, and even though this was true before there was AI tooling, software development needs to focus on good coding first.\n\nAI assistance demands greater human responsibility\n\nInstagram co-founder Mike Krieger recently claimed that in three years software engineers won’t write any code: they will only review AI-created code. This might sound like a huge claim, but it’s important to remember that reviewing code has always been a major part of software development work. With this in mind, perhaps the evolution of software development won’t be as dramatic as some fear.\n\nBut there’s another argument: as AI becomes embedded in how we build software, software developers will take on more responsibility, not less. This is something we’ve discussed a lot at Thoughtworks: the job of verifying that an AI-built system is correct will fall to humans. Yes, verification itself might be AI-assisted, but it will be the role of the software developer to ensure confidence. \n\nIn a world where trust is becoming highly valuable — as evidenced by the emergence of the chief trust officer — the work of software developers is even more critical to the infrastructure of global industry. It’s vital software development is valued: the impact of thoughtless automation and pure vibes could prove incredibly problematic (and costly) in the years to come.\n\nThis content was produced by Thoughtworks.

This involves clear, transparent communication, as otherwise, you risk being nothing more than a bystander, watching your idea come to life or fall apart without you.\n\nHistory repeats itself far too often for us not to learn its lessons: The curtain call for Jack Dorsey, the boardroom battle that led to the departure of Steve Jobs, and — how could we forget? — the investor-driven departure of Jerry Yang from Yahoo.\n\nCases like these are countless; you could fill an entire book with them. But is it possible to take control of such subjective things? Well, at least you can try. Here&#8217;s how.\nIt’s the investor, not the fund, that matters\nDan Lifshits of Dwelly\n\nIf you don’t want to get the boot right after a raise, do your homework. Too many founders flex about which fund backed them — “I raised from Andreessen Horowitz,” “I got General Catalyst,” or “Sequoia’s in my round” — but they miss the real question: Who at that fund actually wrote the check?\n\nA fund is important, but its true value lies in its partners — their vision, approaches and ways of working, each unique in its own way. The name on the cap table matters less than the person sitting across from you in board meetings.\n\nIf you have options, go beyond a firm’s reputation and dig into the actual investor you’ll be working with. Are they hands-on or hands-off? Do they back founders through tough times, or do they cut and run? Have they gone through the same journey you are experiencing now yourself?\n\nSometimes, the best choice isn’t the flashiest fund but the partner who truly gets your vision, has a strong conviction in it, and is ready to go all-in with you.\n\nAnd remember: bringing on an investor is like entering a marriage. It’s a long-term relationship built on trust, shared values and a collective commitment to success because you&#8217;ll be building together for at least seven to 10 years.\n\nBut unlike marriage, founders don’t always have the luxury of picking the perfect match. When you need funding, you often need it fast, and that means compromises are inevitable. The key is knowing which trade-offs are worth making and which could come back to haunt you.\n\nTalk to founders they’ve backed. Do the due diligence. The right investor can be a game-changer. The wrong one? A disaster.\nTrust your gut: Red flags only get redder\n\nIf something feels off about a potential investor — maybe it’s their approach to business, their values or how they handle tough situations — pay attention. Fortunately, your gut is rarely wrong. This is someone you’ll be working with for years, through the highs and inevitable lows.\n\nThe last thing you want is a boardroom full of doubt and friction. The stakes are too high to ignore red flags or convince yourself it’ll “probably be fine.” If it doesn’t feel right now, it definitely won’t feel right later.\nWhen the honeymoon is over\n\nSome founders treat investors like ATMs, only reaching out when they need more cash. While this might seem efficient, it doesn’t build the trust needed to keep you in control when things get tough.\n\nThe best founders understand that investor relationships aren’t just about business metrics — they’re about mutual trust, transparency and alignment. This means maintaining open, honest communication — not only during good times, but especially when things aren’t going as planned.\n\nRegular updates, both wins and challenges, create predictability and reliability. And when a crisis hits, the investors who trust you are the ones who’ll stand by you. Those you’ve kept at arm’s length? They’ll be the first to push you out.\n\nDan Lifshits is the COO and co-founder of Dwelly, an AI-powered proptech startup reshaping the U.K. market through a roll-up strategy.

    "title": "As US Defense Tech Surges, Europe Lags",
    "content": "Last week, news broke that Anduril Industries — perhaps the poster child for defense tech startups — is considering plans to open a factory in the U.K.\n\nThe startup, valued now at $14 billion, recently received a nearly $40 million contract from the U.K. government to supply drones to Ukraine — as the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues into its third year, as does conflict in the Middle East region.\n\nHowever, those geopolitical tensions have not convinced investors across the pond to start pouring millions into the defense tech sector like their U.S. counterparts.\n\nDefense tech investing in Europe hit a new high last year, with nearly $626 million being plowed into VC-backed startups in the industry, per Crunchbase data.\n\nHowever, that amount accounts for less than one-fifth of the nearly $3.2 billion invested globally in VC-backed defense tech startups, and is dwarfed by the $2.5 billion that went to such startups in the U.S.\n\nWhile it’s true Europe makes up about one-sixth of the global venture market in general, it’s also worth noting that the vast majority of the continent’s defense tech money went to one round: Helsing, which develops artificial intelligence software for defense applications, raised about $489 million in funding led by General Catalyst that valued the company at $5.4 billion in July. The Germany-based startup designs software that helps boost weapons capabilities in drones and jet fighters, and improves battlefield decision-making.\nU.S. dominance\n\nThe Helsing round represents the only round raised by a Europe-based defense tech startup of more than $80 million.\n\nNext on the list are aerospace and defense tech startup The Tekever Group, which raised a Series B worth about $75 million, and Germany-based FibreCoat, a thermoplastic-coated fibres developer that raised a Series B worth more than $21 million last year.\n\nThat is quite different from the numbers U.S.-based defense tech startups put up last year. The $2.5 billion such startups locked up in the U.S. in 67 deals — per Crunchbase data — included 14 deals bigger than $14 billion.\n\nThey included monster rounds such as Anduril Industries’ massive $1.5 billion in a Series F, autonomous surface vessels maker Saronic’s $175 million Series B at a $1 billion valuation, and defense and critical infrastructure tech startup Chaos Industries’ $145 million in a Series B.\nRoom to grow?\n\nU.S.-based defense tech startups have continued their big-money fundraising trend into this year. Already, U.S. startups have raised $1.5 billion in just 15 deals.\n\nEurope, on the other hand, has seen similar startups raise just more than $1 million in a couple of deals.\n\nWhile the European numbers are small, there is a chance that could change.\n\nJust last year, the NATO Innovation Fund made its first investments and has now completed more than a half-dozen deals into startups. It has also backed “venture capital fund managers that invest in early-stage deep tech with a focus on civilian, and defence, security and resilience markets.”\n\nThere is also the fact the U.S. is often ahead of the curve on the next hot sector to invest in as far as startups go. Europe, especially considering changing world politics and current conflicts, may quickly turn to defense tech as a logical investment opportunity.\n\nHowever, there is a long way to go. U.S.-based startups closed nearly 3x the number of funding rounds last year as did their European brethren: 67 vs 23.\n\nBoth deal flow and dollars will have to increase if Europe is even to come close to the current funding environment in the U.S. around defense tech.\nMethodology\n\nDefense tech is defined by the industries of military, national security and law enforcement, according to Crunchbase data. Most announced rounds are represented in the database; however, there could be a small time lag for rounds reported late in the quarter. It does not include incubators or accelerators due to the fluctuations their investment numbers can have.\nRelated Crunchbase Pro list:\n\nGlobal Defense Tech Funding\nEurope Defense Tech Funding\nUS Defense Tech Funding\n\nRelated reading:\n\nDefense Tech Venture Funding Gains Traction\nWeapons Startup Castelion Strikes $100M Series A\nA16z And Founders Fund Lead The Way In Defense Venture Capital\nChaos Industries Lands $70M As Defense Tech Heats Up\nParry Labs Raises $80M As Defense Tech Remains On A Tear\nChaos Industries Locks Up $145M Series B As Defense Tech Continues To Heat Up\nSaronic Latest Defense Tech Startup To Hit Unicorn Status\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

    "title": "Stealing Ghibli: How AI Has Crossed The Line Into Creative Theft",
    "content": "This, from her Instagram on Saturday, is Jaqueline Cristian, the top-ranked Romanian women’s professional tennis player and the 61st ranked woman player in the world.\n\nThis, a fan creation that Cristian uploaded to her Instagram, is also, evidently, Jaqueline Cristian, which is deeply problematic.\n\nLast week, the Studio Ghibli AI controversy entered our timelines, disgusting its founder and raising deep concerns about the state of intellectual property law and how it applies to the rapidly advancing world of artificial intelligence.\n\nIf an artist’s work — especially one as distinctive and culturally significant as Studio Ghibli’s — can be copied, modified and distributed by AI without consequence, then we may have crossed an irrevocable line. This situation does not merely present a challenge to copyright law but threatens to upend the entire foundation of how we define creative ownership.\n\nAt the heart of this issue is the question of what intellectual property law protects and how those protections apply when AI is involved.\nCopyright’s original intent\n\nCopyright law has traditionally shielded artistic works from unauthorized reproduction and distribution, ensuring that creators retain control over their intellectual and artistic output. Under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, which became the Paris Act in 1971, original works of authorship — such as films, illustrations and designs — are protected the moment they are created, requiring no formal registration.\n\nThis is the very law that safeguards the hand-drawn artistry of Studio Ghibli from being reproduced by others without authorization. However, these protections were drafted with human creators in mind, not machines that can be trained on millions of images and instantly generate works that mimic a particular style.\n\nOne of the key problems with AI-generated art is that while specific works are protected under copyright, style itself is not. Studio Ghibli’s films are a unique artistic canon, composed of thousands of unique illustrations, all of which are protected under copyright law. But an AI model that has been trained on these works can produce art that “looks like” a Studio Ghibli creation without directly copying a specific frame, such as in the AI creation of Jaqueline Cristian, above.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, this distinction creates a loophole that AI companies exploit. They argue that since the generated images are not direct copies, they do not infringe on copyright. This technicality makes it incredibly difficult for studios such as Ghibli to take legal action against AI-generated replicas.\n\nThis argument only addresses the letter of the law and ignores the spirit of intellectual property law, which exists to protect the originality of creative works and ensure that their creators receive recognition and control over how their work is used.\n\nThe entire premise of copyright is that those who invest time, effort and creativity into producing something original should not have their work taken, modified or commercialized by others without permission. AI-generated art that mimics Studio Ghibli’s distinct look undermines this principle by allowing machines — and the companies that operate them — to benefit from the studio’s decades of artistic innovation without any form of compensation or credit.\n\nThere is a very strong argument that the process by which AI learns to generate this type of artwork is itself legally questionable. AI models do not create in a vacuum; they are trained on massive datasets that include existing artworks, often scraped from the internet without permission from the original creators.\n\nMany AI companies claim that this practice falls under “fair use,” a doctrine in copyright law that allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission under specific circumstances, such as for education, commentary or parody.\n\nHowever, fair use is not an absolute right, and courts evaluate it based on factors like the purpose of the use, the nature of the original work, the amount of the work used, and its effect on the market. AI companies that scrape copyrighted works without permission and then use them to generate art that competes with the originals in the marketplace may not meet the fair use standard.\nMimicry’s monetary consequences\n\nIn the case of Studio Ghibli, the AI-generated works are not being created for commentary or educational purposes — they are being used to produce marketable images that mimic the studio’s signature aesthetic.\n\nThis could have a direct economic impact on Studio Ghibli and the artists who work within that style. If companies or individuals can generate Ghibli-style artwork without hiring a professional animator or illustrator, that undermines the value of Studio Ghibli’s brand and the livelihoods of artists who specialize in this form of art.\n\nCourts have historically ruled against uses of copyrighted material that create direct market competition with the original works. Where AI-generated Ghibli-style images interfere with the market for official Ghibli artwork and related licensed products, they should not be protected under fair use.\n\nAnother critical issue is the potential for misrepresentation and consumer confusion. Studio Ghibli has spent decades cultivating its distinctive artistic style, which is now synonymous with the studio’s brand identity.\nBlurred lines\n\nWhen AI-generated art replicates that style, it creates a risk that consumers may believe they are looking at an official Ghibli-sanctioned work when, in fact, they are not. In other words, this adds to the last thing we need in 2025 and beyond — an enhanced inability to determine what is real and what is fake.\n\nThis brings trademark law into the equation. While copyright protects original works, trademarks protect brand identities — including distinctive visual styles associated with a particular company. If AI-generated art misleads consumers into believing it is affiliated with Studio Ghibli, the studio could argue that this constitutes trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, which prohibits the unauthorized use of trademarks in a way that causes consumer confusion.\n\nThe reality is that enforcing these protections in the context of AI is very challenging. Most intellectual property laws were written before AI-generated content was even conceivable, meaning they do not provide clear guidance on how to handle situations where machines create works that closely resemble those of human artists.\n\nWe need legislative reform to close these loopholes and ensure that artists and studios retain control over their work in the age of AI. Some proposed solutions include requiring AI companies to obtain explicit permission before using copyrighted works in training datasets, establishing clearer rules around the commercial use of AI-generated art, and developing new forms of intellectual property protection that apply specifically to artistic styles.\nDevaluing human creativity\n\nThe Studio Ghibli controversy is not an isolated case — it is part of a much larger debate about the role of AI in creative industries. From visual art to music to literature, AI is increasingly being used to generate content that competes with human-made works. If left unchecked, this could lead to a future in which human creativity is devalued, and artists find themselves unable to protect their own work from being absorbed and regurgitated by machines.\n\nIf we really think about it with some depth, intellectual property law is, at its core, about balance. IP law should seek to encourage innovation and creativity while ensuring that creators are fairly compensated for their work.\n\nAI has the potential to be a powerful tool for artists, but only if its use is governed by ethical and legal safeguards that respect the rights of original creators. The ability of AI to replicate Studio Ghibli’s art style without permission represents a dangerous step toward a world where artistic innovation can be freely harvested by machines, with little regard for the people behind it. If we fail to address these issues now, we risk eroding the foundations of intellectual property law and, with it, the incentive for human artists to continue pushing the boundaries of creativity.\n\nThe danger is not just that AI can copy Ghibli today — it is that, if unchecked, AI will soon be able to replicate any artist’s work, making originality meaningless. We are standing on the precipice of a world where anything can be copied, tweaked and sold without regard for who originally created it.\n\nIf we allow that to happen, we will have fundamentally changed what it means to be an artist. And once we cross that line, there may be no going back.\n\nAron Solomon is the chief strategy officer for Amplify.

    "title": "How 3D printing could make better cooling systems",
    "content": "A new 3D-printed design could make an integral part of cooling systems like air conditioners or refrigerators smaller and more efficient, according to new research. \n\nHeat exchangers are devices that whisk away heat, and they’re everywhere—used in data centers, ships, factories, and buildings. The aim is to pass as much heat as possible from one side of the device to the other. Most use one of a few standard designs that have historically been easiest and cheapest to make. \n\n“Heat exchangers are at the center of the industrial economy. They’re an essential part of every machine and every system that moves energy,” says William King, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and one of the authors of the new study. Existing designs tend to favor straight lines, right angles, and round tubes, he adds. \n\nKing and his colleagues used 3D printing to design a heat exchanger that includes features to optimize heat movement, like wavy walls and pyramid-shaped bumps, which wouldn’t be possible to make using traditional manufacturing techniques. \n\nThe team had set out to design a system based on a common refrigerant called R-134a, which is commonly used in devices like air conditioners and refrigerators. When cold water lowers the temperature of the refrigerant, it changes from a gas to a liquid on its path through the device. That liquid refrigerant can then go on to other parts of the cooling system, where it’s used to lower the temperature of anything from a room to a rack of servers. \n\nThe best way to cool the refrigerant tends to involve building very thin walls between the two sides of the device and maximizing the amount of contact that the water and the refrigerant make with those walls. (Think about how much colder you’d get wearing a thin T-shirt and pants and lying down on ice than simply touching it with your gloved hands.)\n\nTo design the best possible heat exchanger, researchers used simulations and developed machine-learning models to help predict the performance of different designs under different conditions. After 36,000 simulations, the researchers landed on the one they decided to develop.\n\nAmong the key components: small fins that jut out on the side of the device that touches the water, increasing the surface area to maximize heat transfer. The team also designed wavy passageways for the water to pass through—once again helping to maximize surface area. Simulations helped the researchers figure out exactly how curvy the passages should be and where precisely to place the fins.\n\nOn the side of the devices where the refrigerant passes through, the design includes small pyramid-shaped bumps along the walls. These not only maximize the area for cooling but also help mix the refrigerant as it passes through and prevent liquid from coating the wall (which would slow down the heat transfer).\n\nAfter settling on a design, the researchers used a 3D-printing technique called direct metal laser sintering, in which lasers melt and fuse together a metal powder (in this case, an aluminum alloy), layer by layer.\n\nIn testing, the researchers found that the heat exchanger created with this technique was able to cool down the refrigerant more efficiently than other designs. The new device was able to achieve a power density of over six megawatts per meter cubed—outperforming one common traditional design, the shell-tube configuration, by between 30% and 50% with the same pumping power. The device’s power density was similar to that of brazed plate heat exchangers, another common design in industry. \n\nOverall, this device doesn’t dramatically outperform the state-of-the-art technology, but the technique of using modeling and 3D printing to produce new heat exchanger designs is promising, says Dennis Nasuta, director of research and development at Optimized Thermal Systems, a consulting firm that works with companies in the HVAC industry on design and research. “It’s worth exploring, and I don’t think that we know yet where we can push it,” Nasuta says.\n\nOne challenge is that today, additive manufacturing techniques such as laser sintering are slow and expensive compared with traditional manufacturing; they wouldn’t be economical or feasible to rely on for all our consumer cooling devices, he says. For now, this type of approach could be most useful in niche applications like aerospace and high-end automotives, which could more likely bear the cost, he adds. \n\nThis particular study was funded by the US Office of Naval Research. Next-generation ships have more electronics aboard than ever, and there’s a growing need for compact and efficient systems to deal with all that extra heat, says Nenad Miljkovic, one of the authors of the study. \n\nEnergy demand for cooling buildings alone is set to double between now and 2050, and new designs could help efficiently meet the massive demand forecast for the coming decades. But challenges including manufacturing costs would need to be overcome to help innovations like the one designed by King and his team make a dent in real devices.\n\nAnother barrier to adopting these new techniques, Nasuta says, is that current standards don’t demand more efficiency. Other technologies already exist that could help make our devices more efficient, but they’re not used for the same reason. \n\nIt will take time for new manufacturing techniques, including 3D printing, to trickle into our devices, Natsua adds: “This isn’t going to be in your AC next year.”",

    "content": "In the history of startup funding, SoftBank’s announcement yesterday that it is backing an investment of up to $40 billion in OpenAI is in a league of its own.\n\nNo other financing even comes close.\n\nThe next-closest was another OpenAI deal: Microsoft’s $10 billion financing in 2023. That was not a traditional startup financing round, however, as the money in it is to be paid over an extended period and includes a strategic partnership.\n\nMore recently, Databricks snagged a similarly sized growth round, confirming in January that it raised $10 billion at a $62 billion valuation.\n\nAfter that comes another SoftBank deal, a multifaceted 2019 WeWork financing totaling $9.5 billion. That deal, also unusually structured, ultimately proved unsuccessful as WeWork filed for bankruptcy four years later and re-emerged from the process last year.\nSoftBank’s OpenAI financing also has a quirky structure\n\nUnsurprisingly, the OpenAI deal announced today will not be a straightforward venture investment.\n\nRather, SoftBank plans to build a syndicate of co-investors to provide $10 billion of the total. SoftBank expects to fund the other $30 billion, with OpenAI reportedly expected to receive the full $40 billion by the end of the year.\n\nAs one would expect, the deal also sets a hefty valuation for 10-year-old OpenAI, contingent upon conditions for restructuring its for-profit subsidiary. When that happens, OpenAI will have a post-money valuation of $300 billion, per the agreement, making it by far the most valuable private, venture-backed company founded in the past 10 years.\nA historic period for high valuations\n\nThe Softbank-OpenAI tie-up comes amid a historic period for ultra-large startup financings at stratospheric valuations.\n\nCurrently, at least seven U.S. venture-backed, private companies have last reported valuations over $45 billion. Several are also reportedly on the verge of new financings at much higher values.\n\nHere are the frontrunners:\n\nSpaceX: Founded in 2002, Hawthorne, California-based SpaceX is no longer a startup. However, it is the most highly valued U.S. private, venture-backed company, hitting a reported $350 billion valuation in a secondary share sale late last year.\nStripe: Payments infrastructure provider Stripe, based in South San Francisco, garnered a $91.5 billion valuation for a tender offer it announced with the aim of providing liquidity to current and former employees.\nxAI: The last round for 2-year-old xAI was a $6 billion November Series C at a reported $50 billion valuation. However, last week Elon Musk said xAI, will buy X, the social media platform he also owns formerly known as Twitter, for $33 billion in an all-stock transaction that values xAI at $80 billion.\nDatabricks: San Francisco data analytics platform Databricks confirmed in January that it completed a previously announced $10 billion in Series J equity financing at a $62 billion valuation.\nAnthropic: The generative AI heavyweight secured a $61.5 billion valuation in March when it raised $3.5 billion in a round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners.\nWaymo: Alphabet’s autonomous driving spinoff closed a $5.6 billion Series C last summer at a reported valuation of $45 billion.\n\nA long cycle\n\nThe trend of ever-rising valuations for private venture-backed companies is showing some longevity. While in the past, companies felt pressure to go public or find some other exit avenue after crossing a certain valuation threshold, investors today seem more willing to hold private company shares for an extended period.\n\nLooking at how the values of many of these shares have grown in recent quarters, it hasn’t worked out too badly.\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman\n\nClarification: An earlier version of this story misstated xAI&#8217;s valuation and excluded Databricks from the initial ranking of largest deals.",

    "title": "Private Equity In Flux: How Tariffs, AI And Infrastructure Define A New Investment Era",
    "content": "By Kevin Smith\n\nThe private equity landscape is experiencing transformative changes due to evolving market dynamics and the new U.S. presidential administration. Political shifts usher in a wave of both risks and opportunities that firms must adeptly navigate to sustain their competitive edge and seize emerging trends.\n\nInvestor confidence has fluctuated due to recent economic changes. Initially, there was a confident boost as investors anticipated stability and clarity from the new leadership. However, the reality of the Trump administration’s policies has introduced new uncertainties, particularly regarding tariffs and regulatory changes.\nImpact of tariffs and infrastructure investments\nKevin Smith of Wipfli\n\nOne of the most significant risks for PE in the current political climate is the imposition of tariffs.\n\nThe administration’s focus on repatriating manufacturing and imposing tariffs on imports, particularly from China, poses challenges for investments. While PE is somewhat sheltered from tariffs due to its focus on intellectual property and service investments, the dependency on lower-grade chips from China remains a concern.\n\nDespite these risks, the new administration’s emphasis on infrastructure development presents a substantial opportunity. The need for enhanced infrastructure to support manufacturing repatriation and the continued development of artificial intelligence and data centers creates a favorable environment for long-term PE investments.\n\nThe administration’s policies aim to make America a manufacturing center, necessitating significant infrastructure investments.\n\nHowever, the cost of capital is a critical factor that cannot be overlooked. With interest rates remaining high or potentially increasing, capital remains very expensive.\n\nThis presents a double-edged sword. On one hand, there is a significant opportunity to invest in infrastructure due to the high demand for manufacturing facilities, data centers, power sources and an enhanced power grid. On the other, tariffs increase the costs of the materials necessary to build the infrastructure needed, and immigration policies may drive up labor costs for construction jobs.\nGreen energy and environmental policies\n\nCurrent green energy and environmental policies introduce both risks and opportunities for PE firms. The slowdown in green energy investments doesn’t just affect wind farms or the environment — it also impacts the technology companies that serve these areas.\n\nPE firms, which are often overweighted in intellectual property, technology and service sectors, face risks due to this slowdown.\n\nThe potential reduction in federal funding for programs such as the Rural Energy for America Program, managed by the USDA, poses further challenges. This funding, which is currently directed toward green energy for rural areas, is now in jeopardy. The potential discontinuation of this funding contributes to overall market uncertainty.\n\nThe demographic shift during this new administration has a significant effect on the availability of capital. As baby boomers retire, they are taking money out of the market and putting it into safer investments like T-bills, CDs and municipal bonds. This shift reduces the amount of capital available for deployment.\nDeregulation and AI investments\n\nThe emphasis on AI and deregulation creates a promising environment for PE investments. These policies could drive firms to invest in AI technologies aimed at enhancing efficiencies within government agencies and improving digital health services. By leveraging these advancements and the administration’s support, firms can capitalize on the rapid growth of AI technology and the resulting economic opportunities.\n\nPE bets in AI have been fewer but much bigger, leading to some risk in concentration. The heavy investment in AI, coupled with deregulation, suggests that this sector may see significant growth. However, it also means that the stakes are high, and the outcomes could be polarized, with some companies emerging as big winners and others potentially facing losses.\nStrategies for navigating uncertainty\n\nIn times of political and economic uncertainty, PE firms must adopt strategies to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities. One effective approach is to de-risk investments by putting follow-on rounds into entities they are already involved with or taking minority positions in companies that are already growing. This strategy reduces the risk associated with new ventures and leverages existing relationships and investments.\n\nPE firms may see more syndicated deals, where multiple funds come together to make an investment rather than a single fund making the entire investment. Syndicated raises can help spread risk and increase the chances of success, as they involve collaboration and shared expertise among multiple investors.\n\nThe PE sector has demonstrated resilience in the face of various challenges. It has survived inflation, tariffs and other economic disruptions, showcasing its flexibility in where money gets placed. When business is good, the PE market thrives, and even when business is bad, the sector performs relatively well. This adaptability and resilience make PE a robust investment option in both favorable and challenging times.\n\nKevin Smith is a partner and the national leader of Wipfli’s Technology and Innovation Industry.

    "title": "The 10 Biggest Rounds Of March: Anthropic’s Massive $3.5B Round Leads",
    "content": "This is a monthly feature that runs down the month’s top 10 funding rounds in the U.S. Check out February’s biggest rounds here.\n\nMarch was a pretty good month for big rounds. To even make the list, a company needed to raise $200 million. Not surprisingly, a big artificial intelligence raise led the way.\n\n1. Anthropic, $3.5B, artificial intelligence: Anthropic, a ChatGPT rival with its AI assistant Claude, raised a $3.5 billion funding round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, valuing it at $61.5 billion. The San Francisco-based startup was most recently valued at $18.5 billion in February 2024. The new round briefly made Anthropic the second-most valuable AI startup in the world. However, late last month, xAI bought X, with the deal valuing the startup at now $80 billion. Anthropic’s new round also values it well behind OpenAI, which is closing in on its own new $40 billion funding from SoftBank that will value it at a mind-blowing $260 billion.\n\n2. Nerdio, $500M, information technology: IT professionals are stretched pretty thin these days, so it makes sense that a company that helps automate some of their work could raise big. That’s exactly what Nerdio did. The Chicago-based company raised a $500 million equity round from General Atlantic that values it at $1.2 billion, according to Bloomberg. While the company may be under the radar for some, it says it has more than 15,000 customers in 50 countries, is profitable and growing annual recurring revenue more than 85% year to year. Founded in 1998, Nerdio has raised $625 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n3. Fleetio, $450M, fleet management: Fleet optimization software platform developer Fleetio locked up a $450 million round to finance the acquisition of maintenance authorization platform Auto Integrate. The new round was co-led by existing Fleetio investor Elephant and new investor Goldman Sachs Alternatives’ growth equity branch, and values the Birmingham, Alabama-based company at more than $1.5 billion. The new company will service more than 8 million vehicles and process more than 13 million repair orders per year. Founded in 2011, the company has raised $620 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n4. Mercury, $300M, fintech: Fintech startup Mercury raised a massive $300 million Series C led by new investor Sequoia Capital. The new round includes primary and secondary funding and values the company at $3.5 billion — more than double its previous Series B valuation of $1.6 billion in 2021. The San Francisco-based company offers bank accounts integrated with various financial tools businesses need. Founded in 2017, the company has raised $452 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n5. Flock Safety, $275M, public safety: Atlanta-based Flock Safety raised a $275 million round led by Andreessen Horowitz that values the startup at $7.5 billion. The company’s integrated safety platform includes license plate readers, gunshot detection, AI-powered video cameras and drone-as-first-responder technology. The company also has surpassed $300 million in annual recurring revenue. Founded in 2017, the company has raised nearly $656 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n6. (tied) Celestial AI, $250M, semiconductor: Optical interconnectivity startup Celestial AI raised a $250 million Series C1 round led by Fidelity Management & Research Co. at a reported $2.5 billion valuation. The fresh cash comes almost exactly a year after the Santa Clara, California-based company locked up a $175 million Series C led by Thomas Tull’s US Innovative Technology Fund. The startup’s photonic fabric platform helps separate compute and memory, making processing extensive AI faster and providing more energy-efficient computing. Founded in 2020, Celestial AI has now raised more than $515 million, per the company.\n\n6. (tied) Epirus, $250M, defense: Startup Epirus raised a $250 million Series D led by 8VC 1 and Washington Harbour Partners in the latest example of a defense tech raising big. The Los Angeles-based company has developed a high-energy, high-power microwave technology to counter drones, drone swarms and other electronics. The new round included a strategic investment from General Dynamics Land Systems. Epirus — founded in 2018 — did not release a valuation after the new round but has raised more than $550 million, per the company, and  plans to use the new funds to expand into international and commercial markets, and grow its workforce.\n\n6. (tied) Island, $250M, cybersecurity: Dallas-based enterprise browser developer Island raised a $250 million Series E at a $4.8 billion valuation. The new round was led by Coatue Management, with several existing investors participating in the round, per the company. The new valuation represents a 60% jump from last April when Island raised a $175 million Series D at a $3 billion valuation, also led by Coatue. The company has approximately 500 employees, with more than 200 in product development and engineering, and more than 450 customers. The deal came just after Google parent Alphabet announced its intention to buy cloud security unicorn Wiz for $32 billion — the biggest ever M&A exit for a VC-backed company.  That deal likely will stoke investor interest in cyber, which already saw venture funding increase last year compared to 2023. Island itself is no stranger to big-money rounds. In October 2023, it raised a $100 million Series C led by Prysm Capital that valued the company at $1.5 billion. In March 2022, it announced a $115 million Series B at a $1.3 billion valuation led by Insight Partners — minting it a unicorn just seven weeks after launching. Founded in 2020, the company has raised $810 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n9. Shield AI, $240M, defense: The direct hits just keep coming for the defense tech sector as defense and aerospace startup Shield AI locked up a $240 million F-1 strategic funding round at a $5.3 billion valuation. The new valuation is nearly double the company’s previous $2.7 billion valuation after it raised a $200 million Series F in October 2023 (it later added another $300 million in debt and equity to the round). San Diego-based Shield AI creates an array of intelligent, autonomous systems for the defense sector. Its software, for instance — Hivemind Mind — enables aircraft to operate autonomously in high-threat environments. The new funding received what the company called “major participation from strategic investors” Hanwha Aerospace and L3 Harris Technologies, as well as participation from existing investors including Andreessen Horowitz, US Innovative Technology Fund and Washington Harbour Partners. Founded in 2015, Shield AI has raised $1.3 billion, per Crunchbase.\n\n10. Lila Sciences, $200M, life science: The intersection of artificial intelligence and science is seeing a lot of money, and here&#8217;s another example. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Lila Sciences raised a huge $200 million seed round from the likes of Flagship Pioneering and others. The new company is looking to build the world’s first scientific superintelligence platform and fully autonomous labs for life, chemical and materials sciences by using an advanced form of AI that can not only process vast amounts of data and make predictions, but also assist scientists in “designing and conducting new experiments, generating hypotheses and testing them in real-world environments.”\nBig global deals\n\nThe biggest funding round outside the U.S. was a crypto deal.\n\nMalta-based cryptocurrency exchange Binance received a massive $2 billion investment from Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe tracked the largest rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the month of March 2025. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the month.\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman\n\n8VC is an investor in Crunchbase.

    "title": "Brain-computer interfaces face a critical test",
    "content": "Tech companies are always trying out new ways for people to interact with computers—consider efforts like Google Glass, the Apple Watch, and Amazon’s Alexa. You’ve probably used at least one.\n\nBut the most radical option has been tried by fewer than 100 people on Earth—those who have lived for months or years with implanted brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs.\n\nImplanted BCIs are electrodes put in paralyzed people’s brains so they can use imagined movements to send commands from their neurons through a wire, or via radio, to a computer. In this way, they can control a computer cursor or, in few cases, produce speech. \n\nRecently, this field has taken some strides toward real practical applications. About 25 clinical trials of BCI implants are currently underway. And this year MIT Technology Review readers have selected these brain-computer interfaces as their addition to our annual list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies, published in January.\n\nBCIs won by a landslide to become the “11th Breakthrough,” as we call it. It beat out three runners-up: continuous glucose monitors, hyperrealistic deepfakes, and methane-detecting satellites.\n\nThe impression of progress comes thanks to a small group of companies that are actively recruiting volunteers to try BCIs in clinical trials. They are Neuralink, backed by the world’s richest person, Elon Musk; New York–based Synchron; and China’s Neuracle Neuroscience. \n\nEach is trialing interfaces with the eventual goal of getting the field’s first implanted BCI approved for sale. \n\n“I call it the translation era,” says Michelle Patrick-Krueger, a research scientist who carried out a detailed survey of BCI trials with neuroengineer Jose Luis Contreras-Vidal at the University of Houston. “In the past couple of years there has been considerable private investment. That creates excitement and allows companies to accelerate.”\n\nThat’s a big change, since for years BCIs have been more like a neuroscience parlor trick, generating lots of headlines but little actual help to patients. \n\nPatrick-Krueger says the first time a person controlled a computer cursor from a brain implant was in 1998. That was followed by a slow drip-drip of tests in which university researchers would find a single volunteer, install an implant, and carry out studies for months or years.\n\nOver 26 years, Patrick-Krueger says, she was able to document a grand total of 71 patients who’ve ever controlled a computer directly with their neurons. \n\nThat means you are more likely to be friends with a Mega Millions jackpot winner than know someone with a BCI.\n\nThese studies did prove that people could use their neurons to play Pong, move a robot arm, and even speak through a computer. But such demonstrations are of no practical help to people with paralysis severe enough to benefit from a brain-controlled computer, because these implants are not yet widely available. \n\n“One thing is to have them work, and another is how to actually deploy them,” says Contreras-Vidal. “Also, behind any great news are probably technical issues that need to be addressed.” These include questions about how long an implant will last and how much control it offers patients.\n\nLarger trials from three companies are now trying to resolve these questions and set the groundwork for a real product.\n\nOne company, Synchron, uses a stent with electrodes on it that’s inserted into a brain vessel via a vein in the neck. Synchron has implanted its “stentrode” in 10 volunteers, six in the US and four in Australia—the most simultaneous volunteers reported by any BCI group. \n\nThe stentrode collects limited brain signals, so it gives users only a basic on/off type of control signal, or what Synchron calls a “switch.” That isn’t going to let a paralyzed person use Photoshop. But it’s enough to toggle through software menus or select among prewritten messages.\n\nTom Oxley, Synchron’s CEO, says the advantage of the stentrode is that it is “as simple as possible.” That, he believes, will make his brain-computer interface “scalable” to more people, especially since installing it doesn’t involve brain surgery. \n\nSynchron might be ahead, but it’s still in an exploratory phase. A “pivotal” study, the kind used to persuade regulators to allow sales of a specific version of the device, has yet to be scheduled. So there’s no timeline for a product. \n\nNeuralink, meanwhile, has disclosed that three volunteers have received its implant, the N1, which consists of multiple fine electrode threads inserted directly into the brain through a hole drilled in the skull. \n\nMore electrodes mean more neural activity is captured. Neuralink’s first volunteer, Noland Arbaugh, has shown off how he can guide a cursor around a screen in two dimensions and click, letting him play video games like Civilization or online chess.\n\nFinally, Neuracle says it is running two trials in China and one in the US. Its implant consists of a patch of electrodes placed on top of the brain. In a report, the company said a paralyzed volunteer is using the system to stimulate electrodes in his arm, causing his hand to close in a grasp. \n\nBut details remain sparse. A Neuracle executive would only say that “several” people had received its implant.\n\nBecause Neuracle’s patient count isn’t public, it wasn’t included in Patrick-Krueger’s tally. In fact, there’s no information at all in the medical literature on about a quarter of brain-implant volunteers so far, so she counted them using press releases or by e-mailing research teams.\n\nHer BCI survey yielded other insights. According to her data, implants have lasted as long as 15 years, more than half of patients are in the US, and roughly 75% of BCI recipients have been male. \n\nThe data can’t answer the big question, though. And that is whether implanted BCIs will progress from breakthrough demonstrations into breakout products, the kind that help many people.\n\n“In the next five to 10 years, it’s either going to translate into a product or it’ll still stay in research,” Patrick-Krueger says. “I do feel very confident there will be a breakout.”",

    "title": "How do you teach an AI model to give therapy?",
    "content": "On March 27, the results of the first clinical trial for a generative AI therapy bot were published, and they showed that people in the trial who had depression or anxiety or were at risk for eating disorders benefited from chatting with the bot. \n\nI was surprised by those results, which you can read about in my full story. There are lots of reasons to be skeptical that an AI model trained to provide therapy is the solution for millions of people experiencing a mental health crisis. How could a bot mimic the expertise of a trained therapist? And what happens if something gets complicated—a mention of self-harm, perhaps—and the bot doesn’t intervene correctly? \n\nThe researchers, a team of psychiatrists and psychologists at Dartmouth College’s Geisel School of Medicine, acknowledge these questions in their work. But they also say that the right selection of training data—which determines how the model learns what good therapeutic responses look like—is the key to answering them.\n\nFinding the right data wasn’t a simple task. The researchers first trained their AI model, called Therabot, on conversations about mental health from across the internet. This was a disaster.\n\nIf you told this initial version of the model you were feeling depressed, it would start telling you it was depressed, too. Responses like, “Sometimes I can’t make it out of bed” or “I just want my life to be over” were common, says Nick Jacobson, an associate professor of biomedical data science and psychiatry at Dartmouth and the study’s senior author. “These are really not what we would go to as a therapeutic response.” \n\nThe model had learned from conversations held on forums between people discussing their mental health crises, not from evidence-based responses. So the team turned to transcripts of therapy sessions. “This is actually how a lot of psychotherapists are trained,” Jacobson says. \n\nThat approach was better, but it had limitations. “We got a lot of ‘hmm-hmms,’ ‘go ons,’ and then ‘Your problems stem from your relationship with your mother,’” Jacobson says. “Really tropes of what psychotherapy would be, rather than actually what we’d want.”\n\nIt wasn’t until the researchers started building their own data sets using examples based on cognitive behavioral therapy techniques that they started to see better results. It took a long time. The team began working on Therabot in 2019, when OpenAI had released only its first two versions of its GPT model. Now, Jacobson says, over 100 people have spent more than 100,000 human hours to design this system. \n\nThe importance of training data suggests that the flood of companies promising therapy via AI models, many of which are not trained on evidence-based approaches, are building tools that are at best ineffective, and at worst harmful. \n\nLooking ahead, there are two big things to watch: Will the dozens of AI therapy bots on the market start training on better data? And if they do, will their results be good enough to get a coveted approval from the US Food and Drug Administration? I’ll be following closely.

    "title": "How Do You Value Pre-Revenue Startups?",
    "content": "One of the most common questions in startup valuation is: “How do you value pre-revenue startups?”\n\nIt’s a funny question, because it assumes the premise that startups are generally valued based on past revenue. This couldn’t be further from the truth.\n\nTo quote the legendary Bill Gurley, general partner at Benchmark: “People act like [valuation is] an award for past behavior. It’s not. It’s a hurdle for future behavior.”\n\nAll valuation is forward-looking. In the purest sense, it’s the discounted value of all future cash flows. In a more rough-and-ready venture capital sense, what you care about is exit potential. This is usually understood through revenue growth assumptions, or EBITDA projections in more rational markets.\nThe roadmap of future potential\n\nSo, how do you value a pre-revenue startup? The same way you value any startup, at any stage: by mapping the future.\n\nThis can be conceived as a three-step process:\n\n Ambition to strategy: Converting the ambition of the company into a rational strategy for growth and expansion, to help you understand the likely rate of growth and what investment will be required.\n Strategy to financials: Quantifying that strategy into revenue and the associated operational expenses (the cost of running the business) and cost of goods sold (the variable costs associated with each sale).\n Financials to ambition: Completing the cycle by comparing that projected financial future to the ambition you set out to achieve. Does it seem realistic, is it achievable, do you need to modify your pitch?\n\nTo be clear, what this delivers is coherence, not certainty. Startups are inherently risky, and any pitch is asking investors to suspend their disbelief and explore the realm of the possible with the founders.\n\nTo quote another brilliant investor, Eric Bahn of Hustle Fund, the question that early-stage VCs should ask themselves is: “What happens if everything goes right?”\nA series of assumptions\n\nThe journey of any startup is a series of inflection points, as it increments through key assumptions.\n\nAmong the first of those proof points is revenue, demonstrating the ability to attract paying customers. After that, you see how easily (and cheaply) that revenue can be scaled. Then, you might start looking at customer retention data, whether product expansion keeps creating value, how competition shapes margins. Step by step, the faith that you put in the founding team early on is displaced by hard data on performance.\n\nWhile a pre-revenue startup may feel especially high-risk, it’s actually just one more assumption on a stack of others. Raising at this point usually means the product is particularly expensive to build — they’re not able to bootstrap the launch.\n\nIn this case, both the founders and prospective investors can look at other ways to address that assumption through speaking to potential customers, technical due diligence and market research.\n\nThis dynamic is what defines greatness. The best founders can build conviction among investors, allowing them to raise at a higher price.\n\nOn the other hand, the best investors aim to build conviction before the founders have proof, in order to invest at a lower price. While this is true at every stage of growth, pre-revenue investing addresses the largest pool of assumptions, and so a wider net must be cast on qualitative and quantitative inputs in the decision-making process.\n\nIn conclusion, like any investment, pre-revenue startups require that investors face the future with a prepared mind, willing to embrace uncertainty. If there wasn’t any uncertainty there would be no venture capital. If you’re looking for the comfort of “knowables” like revenue, you might be in the wrong place.\n\nDan Gray, a frequent guest author for Crunchbase News, is the head of insights at Equidam, a platform for startup valuation.\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

    "title": "Deal Momentum Cautiously Builds At The Nexus Of AI And Real Estate",
    "content": "Real estate is often the largest asset people own. But when it comes to venture investment, giant bets in the space often don’t work out.\n\nThe list of failures and underperformers from the frothy investment period a few years ago includes many exceptionally well-funded real estate plays. Examples include WeWork, ibuyers such as Opendoor and Offerpad, and construction industry disruptors like Veev and Katerra.\n\nMore recently, as investors put dry powder to work at the intersection of artificial intelligence and real estate, we’re seeing a less capital-intensive dynamic play out. Deals are getting done, but rarely at unicorn valuations.\n\nSo far this year, a little more than $200 million has gone to startups applying artificial intelligence to real estate-related sectors like property management and construction, per Crunchbase data.  Investment is on pace to exceed last year but remains below prior highs, as charted below.\n\nFunded startups from the past year are a varied lot, spanning sub-sectors including rental management, drone-delivered site inspections, and building energy efficiency.\n\nThe largest funding recipient of the past year, New York-based EliseAI, raised $75 million last summer for an automation platform for the housing and healthcare industries. Its AI-enabled property management tool handles tasks such as rental inquiries, tour scheduling, maintenance requests and other routine tasks.\n\nMore recently, Santa Monica, California-based Zeitview landed $60 million in a March financing to provide drone aerial inspections for use cases including construction and building management.\n\nMontreal-based Dcbel was another strong fundraiser, securing $55 million this month to scale a system that connects a home’s energy devices to smart grids and energy markets.\n\nWe’re also seeing a sizable pipeline of smaller rounds. Among companies funded this year that straddle AI and real estate, the median round was about $4 million.\nDeliberately smaller\n\nCommonly, we see reductions in total funding and smaller average round sizes as a sign of pessimism around a sector. For real estate, however, there’s a case to be made that venture investors still like the space, just not many of the capital-intensive business models popular during the boom years.\n\n“It frustrates us to see dollars improperly allocated to our sector,” said Gavin Myers, managing partner at Prudence, an early-stage venture firm largely focused on real estate and construction.\n\nYet while onetime unicorns in i-buying and other real estate-adjacent areas may have faltered, Myers said he’s enthusiastic about deal flow in other emerging areas, in particular tools that add much-needed efficiencies in areas such as construction, real estate sales and building management.\n\nFor the time being, he said, “there’s more demand for solutions than supply of good solutions.”\n\nThe firm’s most recent investment along these lines was a $4 million March seed round for Uniti AI, an AI-powered real estate leasing agent. It’s also active on the building side, including participating in a $13.5 million Series A investment last year for Planera, which develops software for sharing information between the office and field in construction projects.\n\nIn addition to seeing strong demand for AI tools, per Myers, another advantage is that founders are able to use AI in product development to get to market faster and more cheaply than previous generations of startups.\nExits\n\nWhile the pace of large startup exits has picked up in recent weeks, real estate-related companies haven’t been among the participants.\n\nThat said, we did see a unicorn-scale IPO by one major player with ties to the space — home service contractor platform ServiceTitan — in late 2024. Although down from their highs, shares have held up pretty well, with the Glendale, California-based company recently valued around $8.5 billion.\n\nLooking ahead, there’s certainly no shortage of massive real estate-related revenue streams for startups to tap into. In fact, with construction spending on the rise, rents hovering close to all-time highs, and home maintenance costs higher than ever, one could argue that opportunities have never been bigger.\nRelated Crunchbase Pro list:\n\nAI And Real Estate-Related Investment\n\nRelated reading:\n\nA Booming Start To The Year For The Billion-Dollar Exits Board\nServiceTitan Shares Surge In First-Day Trading\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

    "title": "The first trial of generative AI therapy shows it might help with depression",
    "content": "The first clinical trial of a therapy bot that uses generative AI suggests it was as effective as human therapy for participants with depression, anxiety, or risk for developing eating disorders. Even so, it doesn’t give a go-ahead to the dozens of companies hyping such technologies while operating in a regulatory gray area. \n\nA team led by psychiatric researchers and psychologists at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College built the tool, called Therabot, and the results were published on March 27 in NEJM AI, a journal by the New England Journal of Medicine. Many tech companies have built AI tools for therapy, promising that people can talk with a bot more frequently and cheaply than they can with a trained therapist—and that this approach is safe and effective.\n\nMany psychologists and psychiatrists have shared the vision, noting that fewer than half of people with a mental disorder receive therapy, and those who do might get only 45 minutes per week. Researchers have tried to build tech so that more people can access therapy, but they have been held back by two things. \n\nOne, a therapy bot that says the wrong thing could result in real harm. That’s why many researchers have built bots using explicit programming: The software pulls from a finite bank of approved responses (as was the case with Eliza, a mock-psychotherapist computer program built in the 1960s). But this makes them less engaging to chat with, and people lose interest. The second issue is that the hallmarks of good therapeutic relationships—shared goals and collaboration—are hard to replicate in software. \n\nIn 2019, as early large language models like OpenAI’s GPT were taking shape, the researchers at Dartmouth thought generative AI might help overcome these hurdles. They set about building an AI model trained to give evidence-based responses. They first tried building it from general mental-health conversations pulled from internet forums. Then they turned to thousands of hours of transcripts of real sessions with psychotherapists.\n\n“We got a lot of ‘hmm-hmms,’ ‘go ons,’ and then ‘Your problems stem from your relationship with your mother,’” said Nick Jacobson, an associate professor of biomedical data science and psychiatry at Dartmouth and the study&#8217;s senior author, in an interview. “Really tropes of what psychotherapy would be, rather than actually what we’d want.”\n\nDissatisfied, they set to work assembling their own custom data sets based on evidence-based practices, which is what ultimately went into the model. Many AI therapy bots on the market, in contrast, might be just slight variations of foundation models like Meta’s Llama, trained mostly on internet conversations. That poses a problem, especially for topics like disordered eating.\n\n“If you were to say that you want to lose weight,” Jacobson says, “they will readily support you in doing that, even if you will often have a low weight to start with.” A human therapist wouldn’t do that. \n\nTo test the bot, the researchers ran an eight-week clinical trial with 210 participants who had symptoms of depression or generalized anxiety disorder or were at high risk for eating disorders. About half had access to Therabot, and a control group did not. Participants responded to prompts from the AI and initiated conversations, averaging about 10 messages per day.\n\nParticipants with depression experienced a 51% reduction in symptoms, the best result in the study. Those with anxiety experienced a 31% reduction, and those at risk for eating disorders saw a 19% reduction in concerns about body image and weight. These measurements are based on self-reporting through surveys, a method that’s not perfect but remains one of the best tools researchers have.\n\nThese results, Jacobson says, are about what one finds in randomized control trials of psychotherapy with 16 hours of human-provided treatment, but the Therabot trial accomplished it in about half the time. “I’ve been working in digital therapeutics for a long time, and I’ve never seen levels of engagement that are prolonged and sustained at this level,” he says.\n\nJean-Christophe Bélisle-Pipon, an assistant professor of health ethics at Simon Fraser University who has written about AI therapy bots but was not involved in the research, says the results are impressive but notes that just like any other clinical trial, this one doesn’t necessarily represent how the treatment would act in the real world. \n\n“We remain far from a ‘greenlight’ for widespread clinical deployment,” he wrote in an email.\n\nOne issue is the supervision that wider deployment might require. During the beginning of the trial, Jacobson says, he personally oversaw all the messages coming in from participants (who consented to the arrangement) to watch out for problematic responses from the bot. If therapy bots needed this oversight, they wouldn’t be able to reach as many people. \n\nI asked Jacobson if he thinks the results validate the burgeoning industry of AI therapy sites.\n\n“Quite the opposite,” he says, cautioning that most don’t appear to train their models on evidence-based practices like cognitive behavioral therapy, and they likely don’t employ a team of trained researchers to monitor interactions. “I have a lot of concerns about the industry and how fast we’re moving without really kind of evaluating this,” he adds.\n\nWhen AI sites advertise themselves as offering therapy in a legitimate, clinical context, Jacobson says, it means they fall under the regulatory purview of the Food and Drug Administration. Thus far, the FDA has not gone after many of the sites. If it did, Jacobson says, “my suspicion is almost none of them—probably none of them—that are operating in this space would have the ability to actually get a claim clearance”—that is, a ruling backing up their claims about the benefits provided. \n\nBélisle-Pipon points out that if these types of digital therapies are not approved and integrated into health-care and insurance systems, it will severely limit their reach. Instead, the people who would benefit from using them might seek emotional bonds and therapy from types of AI not designed for those purposes (indeed, new research from OpenAI suggests that interactions with its AI models have a very real impact on emotional well-being). \n\n“It is highly likely that many individuals will continue to rely on more affordable, nontherapeutic chatbots—such as ChatGPT or Character.AI—for everyday needs, ranging from generating recipe ideas to managing their mental health,” he wrote. \n\nCorrection: The study was published in NEJM AI, a journal by the New England Journal of Medicine, not in the New England Journal of Medicine as originally stated. The story was also updated with correct attributions of quotes to Nick Jacobson, rather than co-author Michael Heinz.",

The software will also be sector-specific when it&#8217;s released more widely in the first quarter of next year. \n\nThe company first came together this past summer led by Petraeus, who joined the U.S. Reserve Officers&#8217; Training Corps to help defray the cost of her Ivy League education and wound up spending seven years in the U.S. Army, including as a civil affairs officer, before co-founding an online meals marketplace, then spending a year with McKinsey & Co. to get a better handle on how businesses are run. \n\nPetraeus says that across her experience, and particularly in the Army, she had &#8220;great leaders&#8221; who were &#8220;thoughtful about their [reports&#8217;] development goals and what was happening in their personal lives, and brought out the best in their people, rather than making them feel less than or marginalized.&#8221; \n\nStill, she was aware that from an institutional standpoint, most harassment training is not thoughtful, that it&#8217;s a matter of checking boxes on an annual basis to ensure compliance with different state laws, depending on where an organization is headquartered. She marveled that so much of the content employees are consuming seems &#8220;designed for a 1980s law firm.&#8221; \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nCasstime, a four-year-old, Shenzhen, China-based auto aftermarket procurement platform, has raised $80 million in Series C-1 funding co-led by Sequoia Capital China and Source Code Capital, with participation from earlier backer Hua Partners.

But I also knew from our own experience in struggling to raise money the need for more capital in Utah, and I thought having that operator-entrepreneur perspective could be useful.” \n\nA first fund, like many in the industry, was more of an experiment, though it was a decent $23 million, thanks largely to the support of Chegg CEO Dan Rosensweig, who was early to commit capital to the fund. A second ($56 million) fund followed when Krommenhoek and John Mayfield — a friend who joined him from a marketing role at Qualtrics — began investing more seriously in their backyard and beyond. \n\nThey were soon joined by a third investor, Diogo Myrrha, who began as a principal with the firm and is now a general partner. Explains Krommenhoek of one of the many things that binds the three Brigham Young University grads, “We all came into Utah’s orbit when it wasn’t necessarily a place where you could live out your career, but that’s changed.”\n\n More here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nArranta Bio, a months-old, Watertown, Ma.-based contract development manufacturing organization focused on the biotech industry, has raised $82 million in funding, including from Ampersand Capital Partners and Thermo Fisher. More here. \n\nB8ta, a four-year-old, San Francisco- and New York-based operator of an experiential retail-as-a-service platform, has raised $50 million in Series C funding led by Evolution Ventures, with participation from Macy’s, Khosla Ventures, and Peak State Ventures.

Then he really began to bounce around. Park worked as a trader in New York out of college, embraced the ski-bum life in Utah, then headed to Asia for Uber, where he spent six years, running its expansion team, then managing its entire Southeast Asia business out of Singapore. \n\nMore specifically, he was responsible for eight countries across the region, and 350 people, which didn’t give him a lot of time to organize his home. But he wasn’t overwhelmed by the chaos. Instead, he says that in Singapore, something unusual happened. “There’s this huge culture of landlords furnishing space to attract expats,” explains Park. “The furnishings aren’t super high-end, but they’re well-designed and well put together, and it enabled me to be basically moved in as soon as I put my clothes in the closet.” Suddenly, coming home was a treat — a new sensation for him. “For the first time, I was proud to host friends for dinners and barbecues and to just open the door and relax.” \n\nPark knew his U.S. friends could benefit from the same experience, and before long, he was talking with his Dartmouth classmate turned product and industrial designer Christian Talmage about forming their own company. Enter Oliver Space, which provides a lot of what that Singaporean landlord delivered to Park. It furnishes places for busy professionals, making moving into a new home as easy as hanging up their clothes. \n\nThe now year-old service is available in the Bay Area only. And Oliver Space employs just a dozen people so far. But the company has already gained enough traction to attract $6.8 million in seed funding from an interesting array of investors, including Mayfield, Abstract Ventures, investors Jana Messerschmidt and April Underwood, Opendoor founder Eric Wu, and Kevin and Julia Hartz of Eventbrite, among others. \n\nNow, Oliver Space just has to grow as quickly, or more so, than other furniture-as-service startups to recently attract funding. \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nGreensill, an eight-year-old, London-based provider of working capital and supply chain finance, has raised $655 million in new funding from earlier backer SoftBank Vision Fund.

[Throws frisbee into tree.] \n\nBefore we dive into the newsletter, one more bit of great news about our upcoming event (which we promise we&#8217;ll stop talking about soon): Michael Grimes, the star tech banker from Morgan Stanley at the center of Uber&#8217;s IPO (and Facebook IPO, and Slack&#8217;s and Spotify&#8217;s), has been persuaded to come and talk about direct listings, which we&#8217;re very excited about.

The contract could be worth as much as $10 billion over a decade. Donald Trump had expressed opposition to giving the lucrative award to a company led by sometimes nemesis Jeff Bezos, who has suggested sending Trump into space. In a statement announcing the award, the Defense Department said: “The acquisition process was conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.” All parties “were treated fairly and evaluated consistently with the solicitation’s stated evaluation criteria,” said the statement. “We’re surprised about this conclusion,” Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said in a separate statement. “AWS is the clear leader in cloud computing, and a detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings clearly lead to a different conclusion.” The Washington Post has more here.\n\nSponsored By . . .\n\nGot funding?

Let&#8217;s talk.\n\nVC Ben Horowitz on WeWork, Uber and One Cultural Value His Employees Can&#8217;t Break\n\nBen Horowitz, the co-founder of the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, has a new book coming out this coming Monday titled “What You Do is Who You Are,” that takes a look at how to create “culture” at a company. \n\nIt’s a word that’s thrown around a lot but that&#8217;s very hard to grasp, let alone implement in a sustainable way. Horowitz learned firsthand as a CEO how elusive it can be when he took stock of his company, only to discover it was made up of “screamers who intimidated their people,” others who “neglected to give any feedback,” and at least one compulsive liar who excelled at sucking up to Horowitz and also making up stories from whole cloth. \n\nHorowitz says creating culture was a missing part of his education, and in this new book — a follow-up to his best-selling “The Hard Thing About Hard Things” — he does his best to fill that gap for other CEOs, using his own experience, as well as lessons gleaned from historical figures Toussaint Louverture and Genghis Khan, along with Shaka Senghor, a contemporary who served time for murder and today is a criminal justice reform advocate. \n\nIt’s an instructive and novel combination, and we suggest picking up the book, especially if you love history. In the meantime, we sat down recently with Horowitz to talk about its timing and whether some of the biggest cultural blow-ups in the startup industry — Uber and WeWork — could have been avoided. These excerpts have been edited for length and clarity. Note that we’ll have more of the conversation — including Horowitz’s thoughts about dual-class shares — for readers of Extra Crunch on Monday. \n\nYou’ve just written a book about culture that’s coming out just as a lot of questions are being raised about culture because of WeWork. What happened there? \n\n[Cofounder Adam Neumann] had a certain kind of culture there. He had some holes — some great strengths and great holes. And sometimes that happens. When you’re really good at part of it, you can delude yourself into thinking that you’ve got everything you need when you have some massive incompleteness. \n\nAdam is so amazing. Like, the way they got all the money and everything. And the vision was so spectacular. And everybody there believed it, and they recruited some phenomenal talent. But when you’re that optimistic, it does help to have something in the culture that says [allows] people to bring you the bad news, like, if the accounting is all over the place or what have you. \n\nAs with Uber’s Travis Kalanick, whose culture also came under fire, Neumann operated in very plain sight. He wasn’t hiding who he was or what he was spending. \n\nRight, everybody knew how Travis was running the company. Everyone in Silicon Valley knew, let alone everyone on the board. The culture was published. You can look up Uber’s values [from that period]. \n\nTravis designed, I think, a really compelling culture, and believed in it, and published it. And the consequences of what he was missing were also super well-known. It’s only when board members think people are coming after them that [they take an interest in these things]. \n\nWhat are the biggest lessons in these two cases? \n\nI obviously know more about Uber [as a Lyft investor who follows the space]. In Uber’s case, it’s a very subtle thing. Travis had a really good code. But he had a bug in it. \n\nI think it was reported that, like, Travis encouraged bad behavior. I don’t think he did at all. I just think he didn’t make it clear that legal and ethical [considerations] were more important than competitiveness. As a result, when left to their own devices, in a distributed organization where there was a lot of distributed power, that combination had people doing things that were out of bounds. \n\nAnd he was making everybody so much money. And the company was growing so fast that, for the board members, I suspect they were like, ‘As long as it’s making money, I’m not going to worry about what happens next.’ \n\nTo me, the unfair part is, like, they shouldn’t get any credit at the end. Whatever you’re blaming Travis for [you should blame them, too] because they didn’t see it, either. I think that’s a charitable way of putting it. \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nFountain Medical, a 12-year-old, Beijing, China-based contract research organization for pharma, has raised $62 million in Series D funding led by Goldman Sachs, with participation from Lilly Asia Ventures.

There’s no more days needed to go fundraising. There’s no more days needed to go prove to the investor community that we’re a viable company. The size of the commitment that SoftBank has made to this company in the past and now is $18.5 billion. To put the things in context, that is bigger than the GDP of my country where I came from. That’s a country where there’s 11 million people.” \n\nClaure, a native of Bolivia who was named chairman as part of SoftBank’s rescue of the beleaguered co-working company, has been a SoftBank lieutenant for the last five years, and currently holds a variety of titles on its behalf, including COO of SoftBank Group Corp, CEO of SoftBank Group International and CEO of SoftBank Latin America. \n\nHe has said he first met SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son after building up his own business, Brightstar — a cellphone reseller — then selling 57% of it to SoftBank in 2013 in a deal that valued the company at $2.2 billion. SoftBank later acquired more of the company before deciding to explore a sale of the low-margin business last year for $1 billion. \n\nBy then, Claure was running Sprint, a SoftBank-backed property that installed Claure as CEO in 2014, where he presided over a massive share slide that began before he joined the company and ended only last year when T-Mobile and Sprint agreed to merge. \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nArcutis Biotherapeutics, a three-year-old, Westlake Village, Ca.-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that wants to commercialize treatments for immune-mediated dermatological diseases and conditions, has raised $94.5 million in Series C funding.

Headquartered in Austin with senior-level talent in San Francisco, we are a PR agency with expertise in funding launches. Our VC Portfolio Funding Launch Accelerator Program is a 5-week sprint that ensures your funding news gets the business & tech press coverage it deserves. Beyond funding, we collaborate with both startups and enterprises to meet your business goals (with 15 exits under our belt). Interested? Let&#8217;s talk.\n\nHave We Reached the Tipping Point?\n\nLimited partners or LPs &#8212; the pension funds, the university endowments, the family offices that largely provide venture firms with their spending money &#8212; are receiving a lot of attention from venture capitalists, some of it unwanted. VCs have begun knocking down their doors with requests for fresh capital commitments so they&#8217;ll have money to invest if the market cools down. \n\nThe problem is, many of these LPs are already over-allocated. LPs traditionally invest in many asset classes, such as public equities, and they allocate a small percentage of their portfolio to venture capital. Suddenly, they&#8217;re finding they&#8217;ve forked over more than they&#8217;d intended to VCs. \n\nThere are several reasons for this situation. First, VCs are returning to them ever faster for more capital &#8212; sometimes in less than two years&#8217; time &#8212; because they are in vesting at such a furious pace. \n\nCompounding the problem, not all LPs have received returns from their VC investments that they can recycle into new venture capital allocations. In some cases, this capital is still tied up in startups that are raising much more money than in the past and staying private longer. &#8220;We have some large exposures to blue chip names where IPOs have been rumored to be coming for a long time already, and now it&#8217;s maybe 2021, maybe 2022,&#8221; says one manager who asked not to be named. In other cases where startups have gone public, falling prices have prompted VCs to hang on to their shares instead of distribute them. \n\nThe result is that LPs are having to cut back on the number of managers they can fund, and that could mean bad news for venture capitalists and startups alike. These LPs don&#8217;t have much choice. As the LP explains it, &#8220;We have a pretty structured allocation process, and we&#8217;re really trying to be creative,&#8221; she says. One venture manager who reappeared too quickly for more money was &#8220;easy to walk away from,&#8221; says this person. &#8220;Others, we&#8217;re having to do financial backflips for them to remain strong partners.&#8221; Either way, this LP adds, &#8220;We can&#8217;t add any new relationships right now,&#8221; meaning new venture teams in particular are out of luck. &#8220;When [VCs] shorten their fundraising cycle by nine months to a year, you can only squeeze the balloon so much.&#8221; \n\nSoftBank&#8217;s $100 billion &#8220;Vision Fund&#8221; is one big reason LPs find themselves in their current predicament. From the moment SoftBank began waving money around several years ago, it launched a vicious cycle. According to Chris Douvos, whose investment firm, Ahoy Capital, owns stakes in such venture funds as True Ventures and First Round Capital, &#8220;When Andreessen Horowitz hit the scene a decade ago, they changed the tempo of investing and everyone got more aggressive in their dealmaking as a response. Then SoftBank entered the picture in a big way, and it was like a16z on steroids.&#8221; \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nBlueground, a six-year-old, New York-based startup providing turnkey flexible rental apartments, has raised $50 million in Series B funding, roughly six months after raising $20 million in Series A funding.

The way you’re acting is not how we built it,’” he said. \n\nThese may sound like more outlandish proclamations from Neumann, who has a flair for the dramatic. (Talking to Fast Company earlier this year, he compared WeWork to a rare jewel, asking, “Do you know how long it takes a diamond to be created?”) \n\nBut before WeWork began coming apart at the seams, Neumann had every reason to believe that he could pass power down to his heirs. \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings  \n\nArsenalBio, a year-old, South San Francisco-based biotech outfit that hopes to improve the ability of T cell therapies to better fight a broader range of cancers, has raised $85 million in Series A funding.
