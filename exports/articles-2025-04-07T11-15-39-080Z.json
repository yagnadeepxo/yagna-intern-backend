    "title": "Crypto Daybook Americas: XRP, SOL Lead Drop as Bitcoin, Equities Slide in Tariff-Fueled Wipeout",
    "content": "By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)Fear is gripping financial markets, triggered largely by President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, with Hong Kong stocks plunging 14% on Monday, the most since the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, and Taiwan and Japanese stocks sliding 10%.European equities didn’t fare much better. The FTSE 100, DAX and CAC 40 are each down more than 5%. Nor were crypto markets immune. Bitcoin (BTC) fell 10% over 24 hours, dipping below $75,000, and ether (ETH) plunged 22%. XRP and SOL also nosedived more than 20%, while DOGE is down more than 15%. Bitcoin dominance continues to rise, hitting 63%, a level not seen since early 2021. The CoinDesk 20 index, a measure of the broader market, has lost almost 12% in the past day.As for U.S. equities, the S&P 500 is set to start the week already in bear market territory — down 20% from its all-time high and 5% lower in pre-market trading — and on course for what could be the worst three-day performance in its history. China, whose stocks fell 7%, is reportedly considering front-loading stimulus measures to soften the blow. On Friday, it announced a reciprocal 34% tariff on all U.S. goods.“We have massive financial deficits with China, the European Union, and many others,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social over the weekend. \"The only way this problem can be cured is with tariffs, which are now bringing tens of billions of dollars into the U.S. They are already in effect, and a beautiful thing to behold… We are going to reverse [the deficit], and reverse it quickly. Someday people will realize that tariffs, for the United States of America, are a very beautiful thing!”So, where can investors seek refuge? For now, it seems to be U.S. bonds. The 10-year note is up 8% year-to-date, while the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), which tracks the long end of the yield curve, is up 6% as investors pile into government debt, pushing yields lower. This drop in yields is a welcome sign for the U.S. administration.Seasoned investor Bill Ackman noted that Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick doesn’t appear concerned about a potential economic crash, hinting that Lutnick and Cantor Fitzgerald, the financial services firm he used to head, are long bonds. Ackman suggested on X that they could be positioned to profit from a downturn.What’s next? Watch for countries scrambling to avoid the tariffs. Some, like Argentina, Taiwan and India, are already showing signs of conceding and removing tariffs on U.S. imports. The uncertainty surrounding these negotiations will likely keep markets volatile as the Volatility S&P 500 Index (VIX) hits 60 in pre-market trading. That's the highest level since August 2024.

Despite the setback, RWG touted its use of Axis Finance’s sealed-bid auction as a transparent and fair mechanism, though it couldn’t set a clearing price for the REAL token.McGregor had pitched the token as a \"game changer\" for crypto, not a celebrity gimmick, while RWG plans a relaunch despite the collapse.Derivatives PositioningTotal bitcoin futures liquidations hit $58.8M in the past 24 hours, with longs accounting for nearly 75% of the tally. The figures show the positioning was bullish heading into the week, but not out of the ordinary. Open interest in ether futures is holding near the recent record high of 2.24 million ETH while prices are falling as traders short in a slumping market. ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, TRX, DOGE and ADA are seeing negative perpetual funding rates, representing a bias for bearish short positions. In Deribit's options market, traders chased short-duration BTC puts at strikes ranging from $78K to $70K. Both BTC and ETH options showed pricier puts out to the June expiry.

    "title": "Why an overreliance on AI-driven modelling is bad for science",
    "content": "COMMENT\n07 April 2025\nWhy an overreliance on AI-driven modelling is bad for science\nWithout clear protocols to catch errors, artificial intelligence’s growing role in science could do more harm than good.\nBy Arvind Narayanan & Sayash Kapoor\nTwitter\n \nFacebook\n \nEmail\n\nIllustration: Denis Freitas\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence (AI) is exploding across many branches of science. Between 2012 and 2022, the average proportion of scientific papers engaging with AI, across 20 fields, quadrupled (see ‘AI’s rise in research’), including economics, geology, political science and psychology1.\n\nHopes are high that AI can accelerate scientific discovery, because the rate at which fundamental advances are made seems to be slowing down: despite there being more funding, publications and personnel, we are making advances at a slower pace.\n\nBut the rush to adopt AI has consequences. As its use proliferates — in forecasting disease outbreaks, predicting people’s life outcomes and anticipating civil wars — some degree of caution and introspection is warranted. Whereas statistical methods in general carry a risk of being used erroneously, AI carries even greater risks owing to its complexity and black-box nature. And errors are becoming increasingly common, especially when off-the-shelf tools are used by researchers who have limited expertise in computer science. It is easy for researchers to overestimate the predictive capabilities of an AI model, thereby creating the illusion of progress while stalling real advancements.\n\nHere, we discuss the dangers and suggest a set of remedies. Establishing clear scientific guidelines on how to use these tools and techniques is urgent.\n\nThere are many ways in which AI can be deployed in science. It can be used to effectively comb through previous work, or to search a problem space (of, say, drug candidates) for a solution that can then be verified through conventional means.\n\nAnother use of AI is to build a machine-learning model of a phenomenon of interest, and interrogate it to gain knowledge about the world. Researchers call this machine-learning-based science; it can be seen as an upgrade of conventional statistical modelling. Machine-learning modelling is the chainsaw to the hand axe of statistics — powerful and more automated, but dangerous if used incorrectly.\n\nSOURCE: Ref. 1\n\nOur concern is mainly about these modelling-based approaches, in which AI is used to make predictions or test hypotheses about how a system functions. One common source of error is ‘leakage’, an issue that arises when information from a model’s evaluation data improperly influences its training process. When this happens, a machine-learning model might simply memorize patterns in the evaluation data instead of capturing the meaningful patterns behind the phenomenon of interest. This limits the real-world applicability of such models and produces little in terms of scientific knowledge.\n\nThrough our investigations and compiling existing evidence, we have found that papers across at least 30 scientific fields — ranging from psychiatry and molecular biology to computer security — that use machine learning are plagued with leakage2 (see go.nature.com/4ieawbk). It is a type of ‘teaching to the test’, or, worse, giving the answers away before the exam.\n\nFor example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, hundreds of studies stated that AI could diagnose the disease using just chest X-rays or CT scans. A systematic review of 415 such studies found that only 62 met basic quality standards3. Even among them, flaws were widespread, including poor evaluation methods, duplicate data and lack of clarity on whether ‘positive’ cases were from people with a confirmed medical diagnosis.\n\nIn more than a dozen studies, the researchers had used a training data set in which all COVID-positive cases were in adults, and the negatives were in children aged between one and five. As a result, the AI model had merely learnt to distinguish between adults and children, but the researchers mistakenly concluded that they had developed a COVID-19 detector.\n\nIt’s hard to systematically catch errors such as these because evaluating predictive accuracy is notoriously tricky and, as yet, lacks standardization. Computer codebases can be thousands of lines long. Errors can be hard to spot, and a single error can be costly. Thus, we think that the reproducibility crisis in machine-learning-based science is still in its early days.\n\nWith some studies now using large language models in research — for instance, by using them as surrogates for human participants in psychological experiments — there are even more ways in which research might be irreproducible. These models are sensitive to inputs; small changes in the wording of prompts can cause notable changes to outputs. And because the models are often owned and operated by private companies, access to them can be restricted at any point, making such studies difficult to replicate.\n\nFooling ourselves\n\nA greater risk from the hasty adoption of AI and machine learning lies in the fact that the torrent of findings, even if error-free, might not result in true scientific progress.\n\nTo understand that risk, consider the impact of an enormously influential paper from 2001, in which statistician Leo Breiman astutely described the cultural and methodological differences between the fields of statistics and machine learning4.\n\nWill AI jeopardize science photography? There’s still time to create an ethical code of conduct\n\nHe strongly advocated the latter, including the adoption of machine-learning models over simpler statistical models, with predictive accuracy prioritized over questions of how faithfully the model represents nature. In our view, this advocacy did not mention the known limitations of the machine-learning approach. The paper doesn’t make enough of a distinction between the use of machine-learning models in engineering and in the natural sciences. Although Breiman found that such black-box models can work well in engineering, such as by classifying submarines using sonar data, they are harder to use in natural science, in which explaining nature (say, the principles behind the propagation of sound waves in water) is the whole point.\n\nThis confusion is still widespread, and too many researchers are seduced by the commercial success of AI. But just because a modelling approach is good for engineering, it doesn’t mean that it’s good for science.\n\nThere is an old maxim that ‘every model is wrong, but some models are useful’. It takes a lot of work to translate outputs from models to claims about the world. The toolbox of machine learning makes it easier to build models, but it doesn’t necessarily make it easier to extract knowledge about the world, and might well make it harder. As a result, we run the risk of producing more but understanding less5.\n\nScience is not merely a collection of facts or findings. Actual scientific progress happens through theories, which explain a collection of findings, and paradigms, which are conceptual tools for understanding and investigating a domain. As we move from findings to theories to paradigms, things get more abstract, broader and less amenable to automation. We suspect that the rapid proliferation of scientific findings based on AI has not accelerated — and might even have inhibited — these higher levels of progress.\n\nIf researchers in a field are concerned about flaws in individual papers, we can measure their prevalence by analysing a sample of papers. But it is hard to find smoking-gun evidence that scientific communities as a whole are overemphasizing predictive accuracy at the expense of understanding, because it is not possible to access the counterfactual world. That said, historically, there have been many examples of fields getting stuck in a rut even as they excelled at producing individual findings. Among them are alchemy before chemistry, astronomy before the Copernican revolution and geology before plate tectonics.\n\nA shout-out for AI studies that don’t make the headlines\n\nThe story of astronomy is particularly relevant to AI. The model of the Universe with Earth at its centre was extremely accurate at predicting planetary motions, because of tricks such as ‘epicycles’ — the assumption that planets move in circles whose centres revolve around Earth along a larger circular path. In fact, many modern planetarium projectors use this method to compute trajectories.\n\nToday, AI excels at producing the equivalent of epicycles.

    "content": "View image in fullscreen\n Illustration: Guardian Design\nIsrael\n This article is more than 2 months old\nRevealed: Microsoft deepened ties with Israeli military to provide tech support during Gaza war\nThis article is more than 2 months old\n\nLeaked documents shed light on how Israel integrated the US tech giant into its war effort to meet growing demand for cloud and AI tools\n\nHarry Davies and Yuval Abraham in Jerusalem\nThu 23 Jan 2025 11.00 GMT\nShare\n\nThe Israeli military’s reliance on Microsoft’s cloud technology and artificial intelligence systems surged during the most intensive phase of its bombardment of Gaza, leaked documents reveal.\n\nThe files offer an inside view of how Microsoft deepened its relationship with Israel’s defence establishment after 7 October 2023, supplying the military with greater computing and storage services and striking at least $10m in deals to provide thousands of hours of technical support.\n\nMicrosoft’s deep ties with Israel’s military are revealed in an investigation by the Guardian with the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and a Hebrew-language outlet, Local Call. It is based in part on documents obtained by Drop Site News, which has published its own story.\n\nThe investigation, which also draws on interviews with sources from across Israel’s defence and intelligence establishment, sheds new light on how the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) turned to major US tech companies to meet the technological demands of war.\n\nAfter launching its offensive in Gaza in October 2023, the IDF faced a sudden rush in demand for storage and computing power, leading it to swiftly expand its computing infrastructure and embrace what one commander described as “the wonderful world of cloud providers”.\n\nView image in fullscreen\nPalestinians walk through the destruction caused by the Israeli air and ground offensive in Rafah, Gaza Strip early in 2025. Photograph: Mohammad Abu Samra/AP\n\nAs a result, multiple Israeli defence sources said, the IDF has become increasingly dependent on the likes of Microsoft, Amazon and Google to store and analyse greater volumes of data and intelligence information for longer period.\n\nThe leaked documents, which include commercial records from Israel’s defence ministry and files from Microsoft’s Israeli subsidiary, suggest Microsoft’s products and services, chiefly its Azure cloud computing platform, were used by units across Israel’s air, ground and naval forces, as well as its intelligence directorate.\n\nWhile the IDF has used some Microsoft services for administrative purposes, such as email and file management systems, documents and interviews suggest Azure has been used to support combat and intelligence activities.\n\nAs a trusted partner of Israel’s defence ministry, Microsoft was frequently tasked with working on sensitive and highly classified projects. Its staff also worked closely with the IDF’s intelligence directorate, including its elite surveillance division, Unit 8200.\n\nIn recent years, documents show, Microsoft has also provided the Israeli military with large-scale access to OpenAI’s GPT-4 model – the engine behind ChatGPT – thanks to a partnership with the developer of the AI tools which recently changed its policies against working with military and intelligence clients.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment on the findings of the investigation or answer questions about its work for the IDF. An IDF spokesperson said: “We won’t comment on the subject.” ​I​srael’s defence ministry also declined to comment.\n\nThe disclosures about Microsoft’s deep ties to the IDF and the integration of its systems in the war effort illustrate the growth of private-sector involvement in hi-tech warfare and the increasingly blurred distinctions between civilian and military digital infrastructure.\n\nView image in fullscreen\nIsraeli soldiers prepare to release military drones at an undisclosed location near the southern part of the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip in January 2024. Photograph: Atef Safadi/EPA\n\nIn the US, commercial ties between Israel’s military and big tech groups are coming under increasing scrutiny and have sparked protests among tech workers who fear products they build and maintain have enabled a war in Gaza in which Israel stands accused of grave violations of international humanitarian law.\n\nHowever, in a war that has become known for the IDF’s application of novel systems on the battlefield – including AI-driven target recommendation tools such as The Gospel and Lavender – the role played by major US-headquartered tech companies to support Israel’s operations in Gaza has, until now, largely remained out of sight.\n\nA deepening partnership\n\nIn 2021, after Microsoft failed to secure a $1.2bn deal to overhaul Israel’s public sector’s cloud computing infrastructure, its executives looked with envy at Amazon and Google, which had joined forces to win the sprawling contract, known as “Project Nimbus”.\n\nAlthough undoubtedly a blow to Microsoft’s business in Israel and its place as the IDF’s premier cloud provider, documents suggest the company took comfort from indications from Israeli defence officials that it would continue to enjoy a strong partnership with the military.\n\n‘The machine did it coldly’: Israel used AI to identify 37,000 Hamas targets\nRead more\n\nExecutives were hopeful the relationship would continue to grow, thanks in part to the integration of the company’s technology and services in the most complex and secretive parts of the IDF’s operations.\n\nThe leaked documents illustrate how the US tech behemoth supported a range of sensitive activities, including:\n\nAzure, Microsoft’s cloud platform, was used by multiple military intelligence units, including Unit 8200 and Unit 81, which develops cutting-edge spy technology for Israel’s intelligence community.\n\nA system Israeli security forces use to manage the population registry and movement of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, known as “Rolling Stone”, was maintained using Microsoft’s technology.\n\nDuring the Gaza offensive, Microsoft’s suite of communications and messaging systems were used by Ofek, an air force unit responsible for managing large databases of potential targets for lethal strikes known as “target banks”.\n\nMicrosoft’s staff and contractors have also worked closely with military personnel across the IDF, providing advice and technical support both remotely and on military bases.\n\nDo you have information about this story? Email harry.davies@theguardian.com, or (using a non-work phone) use Signal or WhatsApp to message +44 7721 857348.\n\nDuring the Gaza offensive, Microsoft engineers provided support to IDF intelligence units such as Unit 8200 and another secretive spy unit, Unit 9900 – which collects and analyses visual intelligence – to support their use of cloud infrastructure.\n\nAccording to the files, between the start of the war in October 2023 and the end of June 2024, Israel’s defence ministry agreed to buy 19,000 hours of engineering support and consultancy services from Microsoft to assist a wide range of IDF units. The deals appear to have generated about $10m in fees for Microsoft.\n\n‘A paradigm shift’\n\nIn a 2021 book the Guardian revealed he had authored, the head of Unit 8200 at the time forecast the IDF’s demand for cloud computing would lead it to partner with the likes of Microsoft and Amazon “in ways similar to their current relationships” with major weapons manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin.\n\nTwo years later, as Israel embarked on a ground invasion and aerial campaign in Gaza, unprecedented in its speed and intensity, the IDF’s insatiable demand for bombs was matched by its need for greater access to cloud computing services.\n\nThis created an opportunity for Microsoft to deepen its relationship with the IDF. In November 2023, files suggest, Israel’s defence ministry turned to the company to provide rapid support to the military’s central computing unit, known as Mamram.\n\nResponsible for the military’s tech infrastructure, Mamram has been at the forefront of the IDF’s pivot to greater reliance on commercial cloud companies. The unit’s commander told a defence industry conference in Tel Aviv last year how at the start of Israel’s ground invasion IDF systems were overwhelmed, leading the unit to purchase computing power from “the civilian world”.\n\nIn remarks revealed by +972 and Local Call, Col Racheli Dembinsky explained that the most significant advantage the cloud companies provided was their “crazy wealth of services”, including their advanced AI capabilities. Working with these companies, she said, provided the IDF with “very significant operational effectiveness” in Gaza.\n\nAlthough Dembinsky did not mention the names of the cloud providers the IDF is now relying on, the Azure logo along with the logos of Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud featured in her lecture slides.\n\nView image in fullscreen\nAn Israeli fighter jet releases flares, while a drone is seen from Rafah in May 2024. Photograph: Abdel Kreem Hana/AP\n\nAccording to analysis of the leaked documents, the Israeli military’s average monthly consumption of Microsoft Azure’s cloud storage facilities in the first six months of the war was 60% higher than in the four months leading up to the war.\n\nThe documents suggest the military’s consumption of Microsoft’s AI-based products also jumped in a similar period. By the end of March 2024, the military’s monthly consumption of Azure’s suite of machine learning tools was 64 times higher than in September 2023.\n\nPrecisely how the IDF used Azure’s AI-based products was not specified, but documents suggest it drew on a range of AI-powered translation and speech-to-text conversion tools.\n\nThe files also indicate that a significant proportion of the AI-based services paid for by the defence ministry were used by the military on so-called “air-gapped” systems disconnected from the internet and public networks, raising the possibility they may have been used for more sensitive tasks.\n\nThe IDF also appears to have drawn on the AI-based services from Microsoft’s rivals. On Wednesday, the Washington Post reported that Google’s cloud division provided the IDF with access to its AI-based services.\n\nThe military’s use of OpenAI’s products such as its GPT-4 engine – a powerful AI model designed for natural language understanding and generation – also rose sharply in the first six months of the war, files suggest. Its access to the models was made via the Azure platform rather than directly through OpenAI.\n\nAt one stage in 2024, OpenAI’s tools accounted for a quarter of the military’s consumption of machine learning tools provided by Microsoft. The company has in recent years reportedly invested $13bn in OpenAI.\n\nIn January 2024, OpenAI quietly deleted its own restrictions against the use of its services for “military and warfare” activities as part of a comprehensive rewrite of its policies. At around this time, files suggest, the Israeli military’s consumption of the Azure OpenAI suite of products began to spike.\n\nIt was not clear how the military used OpenAI’s models or whether they played any role in supporting combat or intelligence activities.\n\nApproached for comment, OpenAI did not respond to questions about its knowledge of how the Israeli military uses its products. A spokesperson for OpenAI said: “OpenAI does not have a partnership with the IDF.” They referred to OpenAI’s updated usage policy, which forbade its products being used to “develop or use weapons, injure others or destroy property”.\n\nIn May 2024, however, Microsoft began to publicise the ways in which the integration of OpenAI’s tools on its Azure platform presented a “paradigm shift” for defence and intelligence organisations, offering to “augment human capabilities” and achieve “greater speed, accuracy, and efficiency”.\n\nExplore more on these topics\nIsrael\nIsrael-Gaza war\nArtificial intelligence (AI)\nMicrosoft\nMiddle East and north Africa\nnews\nShare\nReuse this content",

    "title": "Two Years Building Workbrew, a Remote-First Enterprise Homebrew Startup",
    "content": "TL;DR: I left GitHub after 10 years to cofound Raise.dev. After an early failed experiment building IoT developer tools, we pivoted and built Workbrew: an enterprise-friendly layer over Homebrew, a project I’ve maintained since 2009 and led since 2019. Two years in, we’ve raised VC funding, built a remote team, and have happy, paying customers. Here’s what I learned so far.\n\nGitHub was a good ride. I got my dream of working for a “Big Tech” US tech company through an acquisition while working entirely remotely from Scotland. When we were acquired by Microsoft in 2018 I predicted to my wife that at some point the bureaucracy would be so stifling that I’d quit. To Microsoft’s credit, this took 4.5 years, much longer than I would have predicted.\n\nWhen I joined GitHub as employee #232, it was already the second-largest company I’d ever worked for. No longer having Neha Batra, the best manager I’ve ever had in my career, as my manager was the straw that broke the camel’s back. When I’d mentioned this was part of my reasoning for leaving, I was told it could be fixed instantly but: that’s not really how I roll. I’d also previously told myself if I get to 10 years with any employer: I should quit to avoid stagnation, even if I loved it.\n\nI still enjoyed it but: I no longer loved it. It just took too long to get anything meaningful done any more and I’m primarily motivated by making developers more productive, not meeting OKRs while achieving the opposite. The money was good but, at least for me, feeling like you’re actually having individual impact has to take priority.\n\nThe startup I joined as a CTO and cofounder on March 1st 2023 was named “Raise.dev”. It had been started in 2019 by John Britton, my friend and former manager at GitHub. In 2021 Vanessa Gennarelli, another friend and former teammate joined him there. I almost joined him in February 2020 but my youngest child’s refusal to sleep and the prospect of a staff engineer promotion changed my mind.\n\nJohn, the classy guy that he is, didn’t do a “hard sell” for me to join him at Raise.dev. If anything, it was the opposite. He introduced me to various other founders and actively encouraged me to interview elsewhere and think about it. He also said he was looking for a cofounder rather than an employee; something that was initially intimidating for me.\n\nA person who helped swing it for me was Brian Corcoran, friend and lynchpin of the Scottish tech scene. I described my various options I was weighing up and he said “oh, so you’re cofounding the startup then?”. When I said I hadn’t decided, he told me that it was obviously the option I was most excited about.\n\nWhen I joined John and Vanessa, they had done a bunch of market research and figured out that there was an opening for developer tools in the IoT space. In true startup style, for my first week John flew over to Edinburgh and stayed in my guest room while we figured out what we were going to build. We zoomed in on shipping something for ESP32s that would enable a GitHub-like deployment flow.\n\n~12 weeks later, we had it in the hands of some potential users. Things did not go well: the onboarding proved punishing and not always successful. The rough edges were things that we did not have control over (e.g. GitHub Actions, C++).\n\nWhen we next met up as a three to discuss what features to build next: I proposed we pivot. I didn’t know what to, just that what we were doing didn’t seem to match our strengths.\n\nJohn had been trying to convince me for literally about 10 years at this point to make “a Homebrew startup”. If you haven’t heard of it, Homebrew is an open-source package manager I’ve been working on since 2009. He (and others) had intro’d me to VCs several times and I’d always gone “where’s the business here, though?” and declined to take it any further. It also felt, in that era of open-source, that most “open-source startups” were a bait-and-switch where a free, liberally licensed project was inevitably yanked away from the community for “commercial reasons” later. I wanted no part in helping someone make a quick buck out of the Homebrew community I’d worked so hard to cultivate.\n\nJohn said: “well, if we’re going to play to our strengths: that’s the Homebrew startup”. I left the meeting, had dinner with my kids and thought: shit. He’s right. We couldn’t play more to our strengths than this. Homebrew now has solid finances and governance, meaning it’s resilient against negative disruption from any organisation. John, Vanessa and I all have most of our background in developer tools and open source. It just made sense.\n\nOf course, minutes into the next meeting discussing it, John comes up with the perfect name: “Workbrew”.\n\nA major advantage of being open-source was having more than a decade’s worth of public requests from large companies that Homebrew decided not to build. Many of these people were told “no” by me. Apparently I’m good at that.\n\nWith a bit of digging, the main things that jumped out were:\n\nI realised fairly quickly this would necessitate the:\n\nI built the basic architecture solo, dogfooded it with myself, John and Vanessa and showed it to some people. This would make the open-source Homebrew project better and allow us to build an independent commercial product, Workbrew, to handle enterprise needs that Homebrew wouldn’t or couldn’t. We got a better response than I anticipated. I guess it was time to go raise some funding.\n\nRaise.dev already had some money in the bank from an existing round that was sustaining the three of us. With Workbrew gaining momentum, we knew it was time to raise more funding to grow the team.\n\nThe TL;DR is we spoke to many VCs, I learned to be less Scottish in terms of both self-deprecation and swearing and raised a round. In true remote-first fashion, we got our first offer before the three of us had even been in the same room together as cofounders. HeavyBit were our lead investor and have proved to be a great partner and source of wisdom for us. They were (pleasantly) starting to badger me to go and hire a team so: it was time.\n\nI left GitHub as a “Principal Engineer”: lots of technical mentoring, but no formal management or hiring responsibilities.\n\nA longer post will follow later on exactly what my interview process was but, suffice to say, it worked out pretty well. We’ve got an incredible, world-class remote-first team with strong cultural alignment. Today, ~63% of us are ex-GitHub employees. Only the cofounders came directly from there. Our shipping velocity is absurdly fast (with guardrails). We help each other, we improve each other and we prioritise kindness and empathy. We work mainly async together across 7 countries and 3 continents. I love it.\n\nSo far, we have managed to get a decent number of happy, paying customers. Customer feedback is a beautiful and valuable thing. We’re following our tweaked versions of a few great existing processes:\n\nWe’re happy to have integrated Workbrew into our stack. We also wanted to mention that the Workbrew team has been very responsive to even the silliest of questions and it’s been a real delight conversing with them.\n\nhttps://levelvc.com/brewing-better-builds-with-workbrew/\n\nThings are going well and everything is trending in the right direction. We’re working with our sales and GTM folks to delight existing and new customers.\n\nI’d read a lot about cofounding a company before doing it. I swore I’d never do it. Whoops. The only thing I knew for sure was that I didn’t want to do this alone (and I’m glad I didn’t). John and Vanessa and I all love, help, praise, improve and irritate each other in equal measure. It’s an incredibly intense relationship and experience. Vaguely similarly to being a parent: the highs are higher and the lows are lower than I expected. I’ve never felt like I’ve been growing more and faster than I am now, though. It’s incredibly motivating to be learning so much and building a company of people who love being here.\n\nI feel like I have almost zero actual advice to give other founders but I feel obligated to try some:\n\nGo get a Workbrew demo and see what the team and our customers love about it.",

    "title": "North America Startup Investment Spiked In Q1 Due To OpenAI, But Seed And Early Stage Fell",
    "content": "North America’s startup investment hit $82 billion in the first quarter, driven by continued enthusiasm around generative AI.\n\nThe Q1 tally represented the highest quarterly funding level in three years. However, nearly half of the total came from a single, record-breaking deal: the SoftBank-led $40 billion financing for OpenAI announced on March 31.\n\nBeyond that giant late-stage round, funding was down in other categories. Both early- and seed-stage investment declined. Reported round counts also fell across stages.\n\nFor perspective, we charted out investment totals, color-coded by stage, for the past nine quarters below.\n\nWe also looked at reported rounds over the same period.\n\nOf course, venture capital isn’t just about putting money into startups. Startup investors also expect returns when companies exit by going public or getting acquired. And by this metric, Q1 was not too shabby, with both the largest startup acquisition ever (Google’s planned $32 billion purchase of Wiz) and CoreWeave’s market debut in an IPO that raised $1.5 billion.\n\nBelow, we’ll take a look in more detail at investment by stage, as well as drill down into M&A and IPO activity for the quarter.\nTable of contents\n\nLate stage and technology growth\nEarly stage\nSeed\nAI\nExits\nM&A\nIPOs\nAn unusual quarter\nMethodology\nGlossary of funding terms\n\nLate stage and technology growth\n\nWe’ll start with late stage, since that’s where most of the money goes.\n\nFor Q1, investors put $66.4 billion into late- and growth-stage deals for U.S. and Canadian companies, per Crunchbase data. That’s roughly quadruple year-ago levels, and up more than 50% from the prior quarter, as charted below.\n\nAs we noted previously, most of the late-stage total came from OpenAI’s record-setting $40 billion financing. However, there were some other big rounds in the mix that helped boost totals.\n\nThe second-largest fundraiser in Q1 was OpenAI rival Anthropic, which picked up $3.5 billion in a March Series E as well as $1 billion in a Google-backed January financing.\n\nSomewhat further behind was augmented reality startup Infinite Reality, which locked up a $3 billion financing in January at a $12.25 billion valuation.\nEarly stage\n\nWhile late-stage dollars flowed, early-stage investment weakened in the first quarter, as investors put an estimated $12.4 billion to work at Series A and Series B.\n\nAs charted below, Q1 marks the lowest point in five quarters for both total investment and round counts.\n\nEven though overall funding was down, however, we did see some exceptionally large rounds in the mix.\n\nApptronik, a developer of general purpose humanoid robots, picked up the quarter’s largest early-stage round, a $403 million February Series A.\n\nNext was Together AI, a provider of infrastructure for developing AI models that raised a $305 Series B, followed by Kardigan, a cardiovascular drug developer that secured $300 million in Series A funding.\nSeed\n\nThe first quarter was also not a particularly robust period for seed investment.\n\nInvestors put a total of $3.2 billion to work via 1,016 reported seed and pre-seed rounds in Q1. That’s by far the lowest tally in years, by both dollars invested and total round counts.\n\nFor nearer-term perspective, we charted seed investment and deal counts for the past five quarters below.\n\nSince it’s not uncommon for seed deals to be reported weeks or months after they close, we’ll expect the Q1 totals to rise a bit over time. However, this is unlikely to alter the broader storyline of lower investment at this stage.\n\nRoughly one-fourth of all seed funding for the quarter came from just two deals: Lila Sciences, a developer of an AI-driven platform for scientific research, landed a $200 million seed financing in March; and StarTower, a blockchain infrastructure startup, secured $50 million in February.\nAI\n\nWith so much of total venture funding going to artificial intelligence, we also took a look at how this space performed during the quarter.\n\nNot surprisingly, given that giant OpenAI deal, it was a huge quarter for AI-related funding, with more than $54 billion going to the space. As you can see in the chart below, that’s by the far the largest total we’ve seen.\n\nExits\n\nThe first quarter was also a comparatively strong period for exits.\n\nAs we’ve chronicled previously, Q1 brought us both a record-setting M&A deal and one of the largest tech IPOs in some time. Altogether, it looked like compelling evidence that the exit environment is heating up. (Although this week’s steep market slide in the aftermath of hefty tariff levies could halt that momentum.)\nM&A\n\nAcquisition activity was particularly strong in Q1.\n\nOver the course of the quarter, acquirers announced plans to purchase at least 10 venture-backed U.S. companies for $1 billion or more, per Crunchbase’s Billion-Dollar Exits Board. That’s the highest total in the past three years.\n\nMoreover, the first quarter’s M&A lineup includes a record-breaking deal: Google’s planned $32 billion purchase of cybersecurity unicorn Wiz, announced in March. If consummated, the deal would be the largest acquisition of a private, venture-backed startup ever.\n\nBelow, we put together a list of the 10 largest announced acquisitions of the quarter.\n\nIPOs\n\nThe startup IPO market wasn’t especially busy this past quarter. However, we did see one significant market debut with AI cloud infrastructure provider CoreWeave’s offering in late March. After several up-and-down trading days, the New Jersey company had a recent market cap around $22 billion.\n\nOther companies that debuted during the quarter included Metsera, a developer of medicines for obesity and metabolic diseases, and Maze Therapeutics, a precision medicine startup.\nAn unusual quarter\n\nTypically, when we look back at a quarter, it’s pretty easy to come up with an adjective or two that sums up the startup investment climate. Things are up, or they’re down. The exit environment looks strong, or it appears to be weakening.\n\nBut Q1 2025 is an unusual period to classify. While total investment is up, that’s entirely due to a single deal announced on the last day of the quarter. At seed and early stage, funding tallies point more to rising investor pessimism.\n\nAs for exit activity, we were beginning to fall deeper into a narrative around the return of big exits. With recent IPO filings by fintechs Klarna and Circle, the stage also looked set for some action in Q2.\n\nBut now, with major indices on track for their largest contraction in years in the wake of Trump administration tariff decrees, the market environment looks far less welcoming.\n\nPerhaps, when we look back at this period, it won’t stand out as the beginning or end of a cycle so much as a unique snippet in time, as well as a deal pipeline reflective of both heightened caution and persistent FOMO.\nMethodology\n\nThe data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of April 2, 2025.\n\nNote that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.\n\nPlease note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.\nGlossary of funding terms\n\nSeed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.\n\nEarly-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.\n\nLate-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round.\n\nTechnology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)\nRelated Crunchbase Pro list:\n\nLargest North American Startup Acquisitions Of Q1 2025\n\nRelated reading:\n\nQ1 Global Startup Funding Posts Strongest Quarter Since Q2 2022 With A Third Going To Massive OpenAI Deal  \nSoftBank And OpenAI Make History With Largest Startup Financing Ever\nWith Google’s $32B Bid For Wiz, Big Exits Are Finally Picking Up\nCoreWeave Closes Flat In First-Day Trading\nEye On AI: Massive OpenAI Deal Masks AI’s Slow Quarter\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

    "title": "Texas Startups Across Sectors Attract Higher Funding",
    "content": "Texas startups are attracting stepped-up funding this year, largely thanks to enthusiasm around cybersecurity, defense tech, robotics and de-extincting mammoths.\n\nIn the first three months of 2025, venture investors have poured nearly $2.9 billion into Lone Star State companies, per Crunchbase data. That represents a clear high point for the past year, charted below, as well as the largest quarterly total in more than two years.\n\nAll about the mega-rounds\n\nIt’s all about big rounds. Per Crunchbase data, roughly two-third of this year’s Texas investment has gone to just five companies.\n\nOf those, the largest funding recipient was Saronic, a developer of autonomous nautical vessels that picked up $600 million at a $4 billion valuation in February. Elad Gil led the financing for the Austin-based company, which is scaling up amid a boom period for defense tech venture investment.\n\nTwo later-stage security-related deals also provided much of the Q1 total. Austin-based NinjaOne, a provider of automated endpoint management, secured $500 million at a $5 billion valuation in February. And Dallas-based Island, developer of a secure enterprise browser, locked up $250 million last week.\nRobots and mammoths\n\nRobotics is another growth sector for venture funding, and Texas is no slouch in this space either.\n\nAustin-based Apptronik, which is developing workplace humanoid robots, announced two weeks ago that it added another $53 million to its Series A, bringing total funding to more than $403 million.\n\nFor those who prefer our lab-engineered creatures a bit more warm and furry, meanwhile, it was encouraging to see Colossal Biosciences secure a $200 million Series C in January. The Austin-based startup is applying gene editing technology to de-extinct woolly mammoths and other species.\nFewer rounds, larger investments\n\nWhile overall funding to Texas startups is on the rise this year, fewer rounds are getting done.\n\nSome of this may be attributable to delays in reporting of seed deals, so round count totals should rise a bit over time. Even accounting for this, however, it’s apparent that investments are skewing larger.\n\nTo illustrate, we charted round counts and investment totals for the past few years below.\n\nIf 2025 continues at the current pace, funding round counts would hit the lowest level in years. That said, when investors do like a Texas company, they’re willing to write very large checks, which goes a long way toward balancing out the drop in deal numbers.\nRelated Crunchbase Pro lists:\n\nTexas Startup Funding\nAustin And Surrounding Cities Funding\n\nRelated reading:\n\nNinjaOne Snags $5B Valuation In Massive $500M Round\nCybersecurity Firm Island Raises $250M, Jumps Valuation To $4.8B\nThe Year Of Humanoid Robots\nDe-Extinction Startup Colossal Biosciences Hits Decacorn Status After $200M Raise\n\nIllustration: Li-Anne Dias",

    "content": "For the first time ever, bitcoin’s (BTC) hashrate hit 1 zettahash (1 ZH/s) on Friday, according to data from Glassnode. The previous record was set on Jan. 31, when the network hit 975 exahashes per second (EH/s). Bitcoin first reached 1 EH/s in 2016 — a milestone that’s now been multiplied 1,000 times.CoinDesk research published on April 3 noted that the hashrate was climbing to record levels, even as bitcoin’s price remained disconnected from this trend. Since then, the price has fallen another 10%, driven in part by President Trump’s tariffs, and is now hovering around $77,000.As the research pointed out, analyzing the hashrate on a 24-hour timeframe can be misleading due to natural block time variability, which is how the record occurred. More accurate insights typically come from using longer-term averages, such as the 7-day moving average, which puts the hashrate at 879 EH/s. Nonetheless, it’s important to note that the milestone is historic.As of Sunday, bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment increased by nearly 7%, pushing the difficulty adjustment to an all-time high at 121.5 trillion (T). This marks the largest upward adjustment since July 2024. While the last 17 adjustments, 14 have been positive, according to Glassnode data. This mechanism ensures that blocks continue to be mined approximately every 10 minutes, maintaining network consistency.Meanwhile, miner revenue per exahash or knows as hashprice—a metric estimating daily income relative to hash power—has fallen to an all-time low of $42.40. This decline is driven by a combination of low transaction fees, rising network difficulty, and a relatively low bitcoin price.Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "content": "Hong Kong&rsquo;s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has introduced new guidelines for crypto exchanges offering staking services.In an April 7 announcement, the SFC announced new guidelines for crypto exchanges offering staking services and locally authorized funds exposed to digital assets involved in staking. The announcement follows recent remarks from Christina Choi, the SFC&rsquo;s executive director of investment products, who said during a speech at the Hong Kong Web3 Festival:&ldquo;The SFC is committed to supporting Hong Kong&rsquo;s Web3 journey.&rdquo;In its announcement, the regulator said it &ldquo;recognizes the potential benefits of staking in enhancing the security of blockchain networks and allowing investors to earn yields.&rdquo; Consequently, the latest guidance allows crypto exchanges to provide staking service offerings.Related:&nbsp;Hong Kong investment firm&rsquo;s shares surge 93% after buying just 1 BitcoinNew rules for staking servicesThe new rules were communicated by the regulator in its latest circular sent to crypto exchanges under its jurisdiction. The SFC requires crypto exchanges to obtain written approval before offering staking services, retain control over staked virtual assets and not delegate custody to third parties.Cryptocurrency exchanges engaged in staking must disclose all relevant risks and details concerning fees, minimum lock-up periods, unstaking processes, outage processes and custodial arrangements to their customers. Lastly, the providers must report on their staking activities to the SFC.A similar circular was sent to SFC-regulated crypto fund operators, with the new rules being relevant to funds with more than 10% of their net asset value invested directly or indirectly in digital assets. Funds can only acquire virtual assets that are also directly available to the local public and rely on SFC-authorized platforms. Leveraged exposure is prohibited.Funds can engage in staking if it is consistent with the fund&rsquo;s objectives, while providing clear disclosure and robust controls. An investor notice and possibly shareholder approval may be required if staking implementation leads to material strategy or risk profile changes.Hong Kong bets on Web3During her recent speech, SFC&rsquo;s Choi recognized that the Web3 space is still evolving and that &ldquo;its full benefits will unfold in time, likely with twists and turns.&rdquo; She cited the speculative industry of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a cautionary tale that justifies caution in the current regulatory approach:&ldquo;Therefore, rather than chasing every new spark, we believe in a pragmatic approach &mdash; strengthening the fundamentals and fostering a supportive ecosystem where Web3 can thrive in a sustainable manner.&ldquo;Related: Hong Kong remains an &lsquo;open and vibrant market&rsquo; for crypto, says financial secretaryThe official&rsquo;s comments follow recent reports that cryptocurrency exchange Bybit announced the shutdown of its NFT marketplace as the market is running out of steam.

    "title": "How to use Render Network for decentralized GPU rendering",
    "content": "Key takeawaysRender Network connects GPU owners with creators, allowing users to rent idle graphics power for AI training, 3D rendering and crypto-related projects.The RNDR token powers the ecosystem, enabling fast, transparent and decentralized transactions between creators and node operators.Decentralized rendering is more accessible and cost-effective than traditional centralized GPU services, solving issues such as pricing, scalability and vendor lock-in.Proof-of-render ensures verified outputs, rewarding only completed, validated tasks while maintaining blockchain-level trust and transparency.The hunger for powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) has skyrocketed. Whether it&rsquo;s training complex AI models or rendering high-fidelity 3D graphics, the demand often outstrips supply.Traditional centralized GPU services, while effective, can be costly and sometimes inaccessible to smaller developers or artists. This is where the Render Network steps in, offering a decentralized approach to GPU rendering.By connecting individuals who have idle GPU power with those who need it, Render Network creates a collaborative ecosystem that benefits both parties. This not only democratizes access to high-performance computing but also introduces a crypto-economic model, utilizing its native RNDR token to facilitate transactions.In the sections that follow, you&rsquo;ll learn how Render Network is contributing to the evolution of AI development and 3D rendering through decentralization and blockchain technology.What is Render Network?At its core, Render Network is like an Airbnb for GPU power. If you&rsquo;ve got a powerful graphics card sitting idle, you can rent it out. And if you&rsquo;re someone building an AI model or rendering a complex 3D scene but don&rsquo;t have enough GPU muscle, you can tap into that unused power &mdash; on demand.Here&rsquo;s how it works:CreatorsThese are the people who need serious computing power &mdash; think AI researchers training models, 3D artists rendering animations or developers working on visually demanding projects. Instead of buying expensive hardware or paying top dollar for centralized cloud services, they can just hop on Render Network and get access to what they need when they need it.Node operatorsOn the flip side, there are folks who have GPUs collecting dust (or at least not being fully used). Maybe it&rsquo;s a gaming rig that&rsquo;s idle during work hours or a small mining setup looking for a better use case. These operators can plug into Render Network, offer up their GPU power, and earn crypto &mdash; specifically RNDR tokens &mdash; for their trouble.RNDR tokenThe RNDR token (RNDR) is the fuel that keeps this whole ecosystem running. It&rsquo;s the currency used to pay for jobs on the network. Creators pay in RNDR; operators earn in RNDR. Everything happens transparently onchain, and the token system helps keep things fair and efficient.In short: Creators get access to affordable, decentralized computing power; node operators get rewarded for sharing their resources; and RNDR tokens make it all tick. It&rsquo;s a win-win setup that&rsquo;s especially useful in AI and crypto-heavy workflows.Did you know? Render Network employs blockchain technology to ensure that every transaction and rendering task is securely recorded, promoting transparency and trust among users.The role of decentralization in GPU renderingIf you&rsquo;ve ever tried renting GPU power from a big cloud provider, you know it can get expensive fast. And even then, you&rsquo;re often competing with major corporations for access to the best hardware. The whole system works, sure, but it&rsquo;s not exactly built with flexibility or accessibility in mind.That&rsquo;s where decentralization comes in. Render Network flips the script by spreading the workload across a global network of independent GPU owners. Instead of relying on a single provider, you&rsquo;re tapping into thousands of available machines &mdash; from gaming rigs to pro-grade render farms &mdash; that might otherwise sit idle.What&rsquo;s the problem with centralized GPU rendering?Centralized services come with a few key headaches:It&rsquo;s pricey: Renting powerful GPUs from the likes of Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud can eat through your budget quickly, especially if you&rsquo;re running long jobs like training an AI model.Scalability is limited: If you suddenly need more power, scaling up isn&rsquo;t always smooth or instant. You&rsquo;re stuck waiting in line &mdash; or paying more for priority access.Access isn&rsquo;t equal: Big corporations tend to hoard the best GPU availability, which makes it harder for smaller teams or indie creators to get what they need when they need it.Vendor lock-in is real: Once you build your pipeline around one provider, switching later can be a pain (and expensive).Why decentralization makes more senseNow, here&rsquo;s what a decentralized network like Render offers instead:Lower costs: Because you&rsquo;re tapping into existing resources that would otherwise be unused, pricing tends to be way more affordable.Flexible scaling: Need more power? The network can grow with you &mdash; just pull in more nodes.Equal access: There&rsquo;s no gatekeeping. Anyone can request GPU resources, and anyone can provide them. It&rsquo;s a much more level playing field.Earn while you sleep: If you&rsquo;ve got a powerful GPU, you can make it work for you by sharing it on the network when you&rsquo;re not using it.All in all, decentralized GPU rendering is quickly becoming the practical choice for AI builders, 3D artists and crypto-native developers who want more control over their tools and budget.The crypto economy within Render NetworkAs you briefly explored, at the heart of Render Network&rsquo;s decentralized rendering platform is its native cryptocurrency, the RNDR token. Let&rsquo;s dive deeper.&nbsp;RNDR token mechanicsThe RNDR token serves as the primary medium of exchange within the Render Network. Creators use RNDR tokens to pay for rendering services, while node operators earn these tokens by providing their GPU power to process rendering tasks. This system creates a self-sustaining economy where computational resources are efficiently allocated and fairly compensated.&nbsp;Additionally, a small percentage of RNDR tokens, ranging from 0.5% to 5%, is charged on every transaction to support the ongoing development and maintenance of the network.Earning RNDR tokensOnce onboarded, node operators can connect their GPUs to the network and start accepting rendering jobs. After successfully completing and submitting a rendering task, the work undergoes verification to ensure quality standards are met. Upon approval, the corresponding RNDR tokens are transferred to the node operator&rsquo;s digital wallet as compensation for their contribution.Spending RNDR tokensCreators looking to access rendering services can acquire RNDR tokens through various cryptocurrency exchanges. Once they have the tokens, they can submit their rendering projects to the network. The system calculates the required RNDR tokens based on the project&rsquo;s complexity and resource demands. After the rendering is completed and the output meets the creator&rsquo;s expectations, the RNDR tokens are released from escrow and transferred to the node operators who processed the job.This token-based economy not only streamlines the transaction process within the Render Network but also fosters a collaborative environment where both creators and node operators benefit from the decentralized exchange of rendering services.Did you know? Render Network utilizes a unique proof-of-render mechanism, which validates completed rendering tasks before compensating node operators. This system mirrors blockchain&rsquo;s transaction validation processes, ensuring that only verified work is rewarded.Getting started with Render NetworkHere&rsquo;s how to get started with Render Network.For creatorsSetting up an account and submitting rendering tasks require the following:Obtain an OctaneRender license: Ensure you have an active OctaneRender license or subscription, which can be purchased from OTOY.Access the Creator Portal: With your OctaneRender credentials, log in to the Creator Portal.Prepare your project: Export your project as an ORBX file using OctaneRender. This format encapsulates all necessary assets and settings for rendering.Submit your job: Upload the ORBX file to the Creator Portal, configure your rendering parameters (such as resolution and sample size), and choose a service tier that fits your needs.Monitor and retrieve results: Once submitted, you can monitor the progress of your rendering tasks through the portal. Upon completion, download your rendered assets directly from the platform.For node operatorsRegistering GPUs on the network requires:Express interest: Complete the Render Network Interest Form to join the onboarding queue.Await onboarding instructions: Once a slot becomes available, the Render Network team will provide further instructions for setting up your node.By following these steps and best practices, both creators and node operators can effectively engage with the Render Network, leveraging its decentralized infrastructure for efficient rendering solutions.A bright future for Render Network?Render Network is quickly becoming a go-to solution for anyone needing serious GPU power &mdash; especially in AI and crypto. Decentralizing access to high-performance computing makes rendering and model training faster, cheaper and way more accessible.What&rsquo;s exciting is where it&rsquo;s headed. The network is expanding to support more advanced AI workflows and exploring deeper integration with other blockchain ecosystems. That means more tools, more flexibility and even broader use cases &mdash; whether you&rsquo;re building with AI, working in 3D or developing onchain applications.At the end of the day, Render Network is creating a new kind of infrastructure where creators and GPU owners can work together, earn and scale. Whether you&rsquo;re here to build or contribute, it could be a space worth jumping into.",

    "title": "How the Pentagon is adapting to China’s technological rise",
    "content": "It’s been just over two months since Kathleen Hicks stepped down as US deputy secretary of defense. As the highest-ranking woman in Pentagon history, Hicks shaped US military posture through an era defined by renewed competition between powerful countries and a scramble to modernize defense technology.  \n\nShe’s currently taking a break before jumping into her (still unannounced) next act. “It’s been refreshing,” she says—but disconnecting isn’t easy. She continues to monitor defense developments closely and expresses concern over potential setbacks: “New administrations have new priorities, and that’s completely expected, but I do worry about just stalling out on progress that we&#8217;ve built over a number of administrations.”\n\nOver the past three decades, Hicks has watched the Pentagon transform—politically, strategically, and technologically. She entered government in the 1990s at the tail end of the Cold War, when optimism and a belief in global cooperation still dominated US foreign policy. But that optimism dimmed. After 9/11, the focus shifted to counterterrorism and nonstate actors. Then came Russia’s resurgence and China’s growing assertiveness. Hicks took two previous breaks from government work—the first to complete a PhD at MIT and the second to join the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), where she focused on defense strategy. “By the time I returned in 2021,” she says, “there was one actor—the PRC (People’s Republic of China)—that had the capability and the will to really contest the international system as it’s set up.”\n\nIn this conversation with MIT Technology Review, Hicks reflects on how the Pentagon is adapting—or failing to adapt—to a new era of geopolitical competition. She discusses China’s technological rise, the future of AI in warfare, and her signature initiative, Replicator, a Pentagon initiative to rapidly field thousands of low-cost autonomous systems such as drones.\n\nYou’ve described China as a “talented fast follower.” Do you still believe that, especially given recent developments in AI and other technologies?\n\nYes, I do. China is the biggest pacing challenge we face, which means it sets the pace for most capability areas for what we need to be able to defeat to deter them. For example, surface maritime capability, missile capability, stealth fighter capability. They set their minds to achieving a certain capability, they tend to get there, and they tend to get there even faster.\n\nThat said, they have a substantial amount of corruption, and they haven’t been engaged in a real conflict or combat operation in the way that Western militaries have trained for or been involved in, and that is a huge X factor in how effective they would be.\n\nChina has made major technological strides, and the old narrative of its being a follower is breaking down—not just in commercial tech, but more broadly. Do you think the US still holds a strategic advantage?\n\nI would never want to underestimate their ability—or any nation’s ability—to innovate organically when they put their minds to it. But I still think it’s a helpful comparison to look at the US model. Because we’re a system of free minds, free people, and free markets, we have the potential to generate much more innovation culturally and organically than a statist model does. That’s our advantage—if we can realize it.\n\nChina is ahead in manufacturing, especially when it comes to drones and other unmanned systems. How big a problem is that for US defense, and can the US catch up?\n\nI do think it’s a massive problem. When we were conceiving Replicator, one of the big concerns was that DJI had just jumped way out ahead on the manufacturing side, and the US had been left behind. A lot of manufacturers here believe they can catch up if given the right contracts—and I agree with that.\n\nWe also spent time identifying broader supply-chain vulnerabilities. Microelectronics was a big one. Critical minerals. Batteries. People sometimes think batteries are just about electrification, but they’re fundamental across our systems—even on ships in the Navy.\n\nWhen it comes to drones specifically, I actually think it’s a solvable problem. The issue isn’t complexity. It’s just about getting enough mass of contracts to scale up manufacturing. If we do that, I believe the US can absolutely compete.\n\nThe Replicator drone program was one of your key initiatives. It promised a very fast timeline—especially compared with the typical defense acquisition cycle. Was that achievable? How is that progressing?\n\nWhen I left in January, we had still lined up for proving out this summer, and I still believe we should see some completion this year. I hope Congress will stay very engaged in trying to ensure that the capability, in fact, comes to fruition. Even just this week with Secretary [Pete] Hegseth out in the Indo-Pacific, he made some passing reference to the [US Indo-Pacific Command] commander, Admiral [Samuel] Paparo, having the flexibility to create the capability needed, and that gives me a lot of confidence of consistency.\n\nCan you talk about how Replicator fits into broader efforts to speed up defense innovation? What’s actually changing inside the system?\n\nTraditionally, defense acquisition is slow and serial—one step after another, which works for massive, long-term systems like submarines. But for things like drones, that just doesn’t cut it. With Replicator, we aimed to shift to a parallel model: integrating hardware, software, policy, and testing all at once. That’s how you get speed—by breaking down silos and running things simultaneously.\n\nIt’s not about “Move fast and break things.” You still have to test and evaluate responsibly. But this approach shows we can move faster without sacrificing accountability—and that’s a big cultural shift.\n\n How important is AI to the future of national defense?\n\nIt’s central. The future of warfare will be about speed and precision—decision advantage. AI helps enable that. It’s about integrating capabilities to create faster, more accurate decision-making: for achieving military objectives, for reducing civilian casualties, and for being able to deter effectively. But we’ve also emphasized responsible AI. If it’s not safe, it’s not going to be effective. That’s been a key focus across administrations.\n\nWhat about generative AI specifically? Does it have real strategic significance yet, or is it still in the experimental phase?\n\nIt does have significance, especially for decision-making and efficiency. We had an effort called Project Lima where we looked at use cases for generative AI—where it might be most useful, and what the rules for responsible use should look like. Some of the biggest use may come first in the back office—human resources, auditing, logistics. But the ability to use generative AI to create a network of capability around unmanned systems or information exchange, either in Replicator or JADC2? That’s where it becomes a real advantage. But those back-office areas are where I would anticipate to see big gains first.\n\n[Editor’s note: JADC2 is Joint All-Domain Command and Control, a DOD initiative to connect sensors from all branches of the armed forces into a unified network powered by artificial intelligence.]\n\nIn recent years, we’ve seen more tech industry figures stepping into national defense conversations—sometimes pushing strong political views or advocating for deregulation. How do you see Silicon Valley’s growing influence on US defense strategy?\n\nThere’s a long history of innovation in this country coming from outside the government—people who look at big national problems and want to help solve them. That kind of engagement is good, especially when their technical expertise lines up with real national security needs.\n\nBut that’s not just one stakeholder group. A healthy democracy includes others, too—workers, environmental voices, allies. We need to reconcile all of that through a functioning democratic process. That’s the only way this works.\n\nHow do you view the involvement of prominent tech entrepreneurs, such as Elon Musk, in shaping national defense policies?\n\nI believe it’s not healthy for any democracy when a single individual wields more power than their technical expertise or official role justifies. We need strong institutions, not just strong personalities.\n\nThe US has long attracted top STEM talent from around the world, including many researchers from China. But in recent years, immigration hurdles and heightened scrutiny have made it harder for foreign-born scientists to stay. Do you see this as a threat to US innovation?\n\nI think you have to be confident that you have a secure research community to do secure work. But much of the work that underpins national defense that’s STEM-related research doesn’t need to be tightly secured in that way, and it really is dependent on a diverse ecosystem of talent. Cutting off talent pipelines is like eating our seed corn. Programs like H-1B visas are really important.\n\nAnd it’s not just about international talent—we need to make sure people from underrepresented communities here in the US see national security as a space where they can contribute. If they don’t feel valued or trusted, they’re less likely to come in and stay.\n\nWhat do you see as the biggest challenge the Department of Defense faces today?\n\nI do think the  trust—or the lack of it—is a big challenge. Whether it’s trust in government broadly or specific concerns like military spending, audits, or politicization of the uniformed military, that issue manifests in everything DOD is trying to get done. It affects our ability to work with Congress, with allies, with industry, and with the American people. If people don’t believe you’re working in their interest, it’s hard to get anything done.",

    "content": "Financial markets are in a meltdown and every leg lower is strengthening expectations in the credit market that the Fed will soon offer support. Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded 8% lower at $75,800 and the U.S. stocks were on track for their worst three-day performance, with S&P 500 futures down roughly 5% on Monday alone and losses approaching 15% overall. The Fed has a history of intervening during financial meltdowns with rate cuts and other stimulus measures. So, traders, having become accustomed to liquidity support, are betting that the Fed will act similarly this time.According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the federal funds futures market is now pricing in as many as five rate cuts in 2025. For the upcoming May 7 meeting, there's a 61% probability of a 25 basis point cut, which would lower the target range to 4.25–4.50%. By year-end, the market sees the fed funds rate falling as low as 3.00–3.25%.The risk-off, coupled with the growth scare and Fed rate cut bets, is giving Trump administration what it wants – plunging Treasury yields. The all-important 10-year yield — the benchmark for the U.S. economy — has dropped to 3.923%. The popular narrative is that lower yields would make it easier for the Treasury to refinance trillions of dollars in debt in the coming 12 months, which is why the Trump administration may be more tolerant of the asset market swoon.This refinancing urgency stems from a policy shift under former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who moved from longer-dated coupon issuance to short-term Treasury bills. Since 2023, about two-thirds of the deficit had been financed through bill issuance — short-term debt with rates hovering around 5%. While this may have temporarily supported liquidity, it created a ticking time bomb of expensive short-term debt that now needs to be rolled over.",

As the crypto market's correction kicks off, days after traditional financial markets started reacting to President Donald Trump's tariffs, bitcoin (BTC) slumped to its lowest level in five months, dropping to as low as $74,500 and marking a full one-third drop from the record high it hit Jan. 20.This slide has left Strategy (MSTR) marginally in the green on its bitcoin acquisition strategy. At a total cost of $35.6 billion, the company currently holds an unrealized profit of about 10%, or roughly $3.9 billion on its BTC investment. Strategy owns 528,185 BTC, now valued at $39.5 billion, giving it an average cost basis of $67,458 per bitcoin.

    "title": "The future of American dynamism depends on cryptography",
    "content": "Opinion by: Ismael Hishon-Rezaizadeh, co-founder and CEO of LagrangeTrade wars and proxy wars are underway in the current geopolitical power realignment, but the next phase won&rsquo;t be fought with tariffs or drones. It will be decided by who leads in cryptography. Just as past industrial and technological revolutions in its private sector yielded the US an edge in global power, the ability to secure and verify information through cryptographic breakthroughs, especially in zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, will determine the balance of power in the digital age.The US risks falling behind. While China and other nations invest aggressively in technological advancements, America lacks a national strategy to maintain leadership in this critical domain. It&rsquo;s time to recognize cryptography as a foundational technological asset and a key to securing the country&rsquo;s economic and national security future.From industrial mightDuring the world wars of the previous century, the US maintained a dominant global position through industrial strength. The country supplied around 75% of the oil used by the Allies in WWI and around 85% of their oil in WWII. The US also manufactured approximately two-thirds of all military equipment used by the Allies in the latter, playing a pivotal role in the war&rsquo;s outcome.Industrial strength was not merely an asset. It was a strategic advantage in global conflicts. American influence will continue to be tied to the private sector&rsquo;s innovations, especially as we move into more technologically advanced forms of warfare.To software superioritySuperiority in software has become the most efficient way to sustain US leadership worldwide. Stuxnet offers an example in recent history. In 2010, the software-based operation led by the US and Israeli governments was able to remotely crash Iran&rsquo;s nuclear development program without deploying a single soldier.Recent: &lsquo;National emergency&rsquo; as Trump&rsquo;s tariffs dent crypto pricesToday&rsquo;s private companies have followed suit and developed new software technologies for national defense purposes that have become essential in maintaining the US&rsquo;s competitive edge. Defense contractors have enhanced US global influence with their contributions to AI, surveillance and advanced analytics for national security purposes.&nbsp;The historical trend is set to continue as cryptography starts to play an increasingly important role in defense technology.Cryptography and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofsThe use cases for cryptography, specifically ZK-proofs, extend far beyond the protection of financial transactions. Consider a shift in focus from the AI race for a bit. In that case, ZK-proofs become critical for more immediately tangible purposes, such as securing the country&rsquo;s digital infrastructure.The US Department of Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Department of Defense have already acknowledged the strategic importance of ZK-proofs for defense and national security and developed the Securing Information for Encrypted Verification and Evaluation (SIEVE) program. NASA and the European Space Agency are exploring blockchain and ZK-proofs to ensure the authenticity of satellite communication commands and prevent cyberattacks.Private sector contributions are embedding secure cryptographic elements into drones to prevent hacking and ensure safe defense and critical infrastructure operations. At the same time, cybersecurity firms are leveraging blockchain to create secure digital identity ecosystems.&nbsp;The private sector is currently at the forefront of innovation in this field. In 2019, there was a boom in research papers focused on ZK-proof technology driven by private efforts to find better solutions in blockchain scalability via ZK-rollups.&nbsp;New and innovative approaches to ZK-proofs emerged, with most of the research being led and funded by crypto companies in the private sector. These are all production-ready, future-proof technologies that are finding their way into civilian applications but could be applied to military purposes just as quickly.Global leadership through innovationAmerica&rsquo;s dynamism in the digital age, particularly in cryptography and blockchain technologies, will define its future role as a global power. The US must make bold, strategic investments in private-sector and public-sector research and development for ZK-proofs to maintain its leadership in cryptographic technologies, which are now indispensable to national security, defense and economic stability.&nbsp;With a pro-crypto administration and a supportive Congress, the time has come to move beyond merely regulating crypto as an investment class. There must be active cultivation and support for innovation in cryptography and emerging technologies like zero-knowledge proofs. The centuries-old relationship between the private sector and the government must continue to defend national interests.&nbsp;This is America&rsquo;s moment to build a new wave of industrial and technological dominance. It&rsquo;s time to seize this opportunity and ensure the next century of global leadership is powered by American innovation.Opinion by: Ismael Hishon-Rezaizadeh, co-founder and CEO of Lagrange.

I built it for two simple reasons: 1.I needed a solid and easy-to-use analytics solution for my own projects. 2.I'm naturally curious (okay, a bit geeky ) and wanted to see firsthand how these platforms handle tons of events. Initially, I challenged myself to create and launch the MVP in just three weeks. Honestly, it wasn't perfect—in fact, it was pretty rough. But I decided to launch anyway, and surprisingly, I got a few clients who actually liked it. Two or three months ago, I started rebuilding it from the ground up, and I'm excited to finally share Alytica v2! This new version is exactly what I had in mind from the start—more reliable, user-friendly, and packed with improvements. And there's still plenty more coming soon. To celebrate this relaunch, I'm giving the first 100 users 20% off their first month with the code LAUNCH20. There's also a free plan available, so you can easily try it out without any commitment. Check it out at alytica.tech and let me know what you think! Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43608973 Points: 1 # Comments: 0",

    "title": "Crypto Sell-Off Worsens With XRP, SOL, DOGE Down 20%, Traders See More Pain Ahead of US Open",
    "content": "A crypto market sell-off went from bad to brutal in European morning hours Monday as bitcoin pierced the $75,000 level — extending losses on major tokens to nearly 20%.Tokens XRP, solana (SOL), and dogecoin (DOGE) plunged over 5% in the hours ahead of the European open, erasing tens of billions in market capitalization, driven by a cascade of macroeconomic uncertainty and aggressive liquidations that neared $1 billion.The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, which tracks the largest tokens, slumped 12%, signaling a widespread risk-off sentiment gripping the sector.XRP and SOL led the decline, each nosediving more than 20% in the past 24 hours and breaking under critical support levels. XRP, trading at $1.70, has slipped below its critical 200-day moving average — a key technical support level — raising fears of further downside toward $1.75.SOL, meanwhile, dropped under $100, breaching its 50-day moving average and marking a 64% retreat from its all-time high. DOGE, the meme coin darling, wasn’t spared, tumbling 20% to $0.13, as a CoinDesk analysis noted earlier Monday.President Donald Trump’s recent 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, coupled with a doubled 20% levy on China, have sparked retaliatory threats.China is mulling front-loaded stimulus to counter these measures, adding to market jitters, as reported. Investors are fleeing risk assets for safe havens like gold, and the Japanese yen.Meanwhile, traders expect the market decline to continue through the Asian day ahead of the U.S. open.“Historically, crypto markets tend to front-run stock markets over the weekend, and this morning's Asia market declines seem to have reinforced this belief,” Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “We expect crypto markets to dip once US markets open.”“As to whether or not they’ll recover depends on which large countries are able to secure short-term tariff delays or deals this week. Thus far, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Taiwan have already pledged to lower their own tariffs and/or increase US investment in exchange for relief, but we would need a larger trading partner like Japan or China to do so to restore confidence and certainty in the markets,” Mei added.Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus, said current price action was displaying bear market behaviour.“All the signs suggest that macro markets are now in 'bear market' mode, rallies are to be sold, and investors will be forced to accept this new reality against the long-term wagers being made,” Fan said in a Telegram message. “The market will likely continue to frustrate and shake investor confidence for quite a while longer.”“Over the longer term, charts might argue that BTC has broken out against global equities and is overdue to catch up with spot gold, but catalysts appear to be fleeting at this time and risk management (ie. lower prices) will likely dominate until global stops melting down,” Fan ended.",

    "title": "Tariff-Sensitive Australian Dollar Offers Hope to Bitcoin Bulls as BTC Drops Below $75K",
    "content": "Roughly 10 weeks ago, CoinDesk discussed a double top bearish reversal pattern in bitcoin (BTC), warning of a sell-off to $75,000 in a move typical of a bull-market pull back. On Monday, the price dropped below that level as escalating trade tensions cratered financial markets, sending Dow Jones Industrial Average futures lower by a whooping 900 points. According to technical analysis theory, the BTC sell-off could run out of steam between $70K and $75K, as discussed in January. Besides, the Australian dollar (AUD), a commodity currency particularly vulnerable to Trump-led global trade tensions, is offering hope to crypto bulls. The AUD/USD pair has recovered to 0.6011 after dropping as low as 0.5930 earlier Monday, according to data source TradingView. The pair was the worst hit on Friday, falling over 4%, a big move for a national currency.When trade tensions escalate, currencies of nations involved in the tussle typically react quickly due to expected changes in trade balances, economic conditions and interest-rate expectations. The AUD is one such currency. As the home currency of commodity exporter Australia, it's seen as a proxy for China, one of the country's biggest customers. So, the sharp recovery in the AUD could be a sign of tariffs-led sell-off reaching climax. That said, bottom fishing in a falling market is akin to catching a falling knife, a risky strategy.",

    "title": "Tried automating crypto trades with Grok 3? Here’s what happens",
    "content": "Key takeawaysGrok 3 adjusts its predictions based on evolving market trends by analyzing real-time data patterns.Combining technical analysis with sentiment data improves accuracy; Grok 3 effectively identifies potential trade opportunities.Backtesting strategies before live trading is crucial; testing Grok 3&rsquo;s prompts using historical data helps refine conditions and improve performance.While Grok 3 can automate trades, human oversight remains critical in adapting to unexpected market conditions.Crypto trading is complex. Prices can swing wildly, and even experienced traders struggle to keep up. That&rsquo;s why automation tools are gaining attention, with many now exploring Grok 3, an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) model from xAI (founded by Elon Musk).Grok 3 wasn&rsquo;t built specifically for trading, but its ability to analyze data, spot patterns and interpret trends has encouraged traders to test it for automated strategies. The idea is simple: Let Grok 3 make data-driven decisions, removing the emotional guesswork that often leads to poor trades.But does it actually work? Some traders report impressive results, while others find it unpredictable, especially in volatile markets.This article digs into what happens when you automate crypto trades with Grok 3. From successful strategies to unexpected risks, you&rsquo;ll get a clear picture of what to expect, plus actionable tips to improve your results.What is Grok 3 and how does it relate to crypto trading?Grok 3 is an AI model designed by xAI, an artificial intelligence company founded by Elon Musk. While its primary focus is natural language processing, some traders are now testing Grok 3 as a potential tool for improving crypto trading strategies. Unlike traditional trading bots operating on rigid rules, Grok 3&rsquo;s flexible design allows it to analyze diverse data sources and uncover patterns that might be overlooked.Why some traders are turning to Grok 3Grok 3&rsquo;s appeal lies in its ability to handle complex data, a crucial advantage in crypto markets, where price moves are often triggered by unexpected events or sentiment shifts.Here&rsquo;s where traders say Grok 3 has potential:Identifying market sentiment trends: Crypto markets are heavily influenced by emotions like FOMO (fear of missing out) and FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt). Grok 3 can analyze social media, news headlines and community discussions to assess changing sentiment, a key factor in crypto volatility.Recognizing hidden patterns: Grok 3&rsquo;s machine learning capabilities allow it to detect subtle correlations between indicators that traditional bots may overlook. For instance, Grok 3 may link an increase in social sentiment with rising whale activity to predict bullish momentum.Flexible analysis based on prompts: Rather than following static rules like &ldquo;Buy when RSI falls below 30,&rdquo; Grok 3 enables traders to design more complex strategies using natural language instructions.What happens when Grok 3 is used to automate crypto trades?Grok 3 isn&rsquo;t your typical crypto trading bot. It doesn&rsquo;t place trades directly or integrate with exchanges on its own. But it can help traders build smarter, faster and more flexible automation systems. From writing trade logic to analyzing market sentiment, Grok 3 is already being used in the real world to streamline how crypto strategies are created and tested.Instead of manually scripting every piece of logic, traders are now using Grok 3 to generate working code for bots. For example, a user asked Grok 3 to write token buy/sell logic with parameters like slippage, take-profit and gas priority fees. It generated a script that can be plugged into DeFi tools or expanded with 0x and Uniswap APIs.Some traders use Grok 3 to build end-to-end bots tailored to niche tokens or specific strategies. In another example, Grok 3 was used to create an automated system that scans price action and triggers trades under strict conditions. It doesn&rsquo;t just stop at buy/sell logic. Grok also writes portfolio rebalancing scripts and can simulate how positions would perform under different volatility conditions.Here is an example of a prompt fed into Grok 3, along with the output received.Grok 3&rsquo;s response: High-frequency trading bot framework for Solana (SOL)Below is a structured outline for a high-frequency trading bot framework designed for Solana (SOL), focusing on one-minute price fluctuations, risk management and trade execution. This outline provides a modular structure with placeholders for key components, avoiding specific implementation details as requested.1. Core configurationPurpose: Define global settings and constants for the bot.Components:Solana network endpoint (e.g., mainnet RPC URL)Wallet configuration (private key or keypair for trading)Trading pair (e.g., SOL/USDC)Timeframe (one-minute candlestick data)Trade size ($100 per position)Max trades (10 concurrent or sequential positions)Profit target ($50 total)Max loss per trade ($20)2. Data acquisition modulePurpose: Fetch and process real-time SOL price data.Components:WebSocket connection to Solana blockchain or exchange API (e.g., Serum, Raydium, or centralized exchange like Binance)1-minute OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data streamData buffer for storing recent price historyError handling for connection drops or latency3. Volatility analysis modulePurpose: Assess SOL&rsquo;s price volatility to inform trade decisions.Components:Placeholder: Calculate short-term volatility (e.g., standard deviation or ATR over one-minute candles)Placeholder: Define volatility thresholds (e.g., high/low volatility states)Output: Volatility score or signal to adjust trade frequency/size4. Trade signal generatorPurpose: Generate buy/sell signals based on price fluctuations.Components:Placeholder: Simple momentum strategy (e.g., price crossing a short-term moving average)Placeholder: Filter signals using volatility analysisSignal validation (e.g., avoid over-trading within one-minute window)Output: Buy/sell signal with timestamp5. Risk management modulePurpose: Enforce risk controls and position limits.Components:Position size calculator (fixed at $100 per trade)Max loss check ($20 per trade stop-loss)Total profit/loss tracker (halt at $50 profit or after 10 trades)Concurrent trade limiter (cap at 10 active positions)Emergency stop (pause bot on extreme volatility or connectivity loss)6. Trade execution modulePurpose: Execute trades on the Solana blockchain or exchange.Components:Placeholder: Build Solana transaction (e.g., swap SOL for USDC via a DEX like Raydium)Order type (market order for speed in one-minute timeframe)Slippage tolerance (e.g., 0.5% max slippage)Transaction signing and submissionConfirmation listener (await transaction finality)Error handling (e.g., retry on failed execution)7. Performance monitoring modulePurpose: Track and log bot performance in real time.Components:Trade log (entry price, exit price, profit/loss, timestamp)Running total profit/loss calculatorPerformance metrics (e.g., win rate, average trade duration)Alert system (notify on profit target, max loss, or errors)8. Main control loopPurpose: Orchestrate bot operations in a continuous cycle.Components:Initialize bot (load config, connect to data feed)Loop:Fetch one-minute price dataAnalyze volatilityGenerate trade signalApply risk management checksExecute trade if conditions metUpdate performance metricsExit conditions (profit target hit, max trades reached, or manual stop)9. Shutdown and cleanupPurpose: Safely terminate the bot and finalize operations.Components:Close open WebSocket connectionsFinalize pending transactionsSave trade log and performance summaryRelease resources (e.g., memory, wallet connections)NotesThis framework assumes integration with Solana&rsquo;s ecosystem (e.g., using a DEX or liquidity pool). Adjust the execution module if targeting a centralized exchange.Volatility analysis and signal generation are left as placeholders for customization (e.g., technical indicators or machine learning models).Risk management is strict to align with the $50 profit goal and $20 max loss per trade, ensuring the bot operates within defined boundaries.Caution! The above is a tailored outline shaped by the user&rsquo;s prompt, targeting one-minute price fluctuations, risk management and trade execution. Its output varies with prompt detail, as specificity sharpens results. Moreover, placeholders like volatility analysis await user customization, reflecting Grok 3&rsquo;s adaptive learning. It&rsquo;s a conceptual guide, not code, and success hinges on implementation and market conditions. For deeper refinement, such as Solana-specific tweaks, users can provide more context. Grok 3 adjusts using their input and its latest insights.Let&rsquo;s learn the general steps required to set up Grok 3 for automated crypto trading.How to set up Grok 3 for automated crypto tradingSetting up Grok 3 for AI-powered crypto trading automation isn&rsquo;t as straightforward as installing a typical trading bot. Since Grok 3 wasn&rsquo;t built for direct trading, it requires thoughtful setup, integration and customization. Below is a practical guide to setting up Grok 3 effectively for automated crypto trading with AI (artificial intelligence).Step 1: Choosing a compatible trading platformSince Grok 3 doesn&rsquo;t connect directly to crypto exchanges, it requires integration with third-party platforms that support API automation. Platforms like:3Commas: Ideal for executing trades via automated strategies.TradingView: Used for generating trade signals using Pine Script.CryptoHopper: Offers custom strategy-building tools with API integration.Ensure that the chosen platform offers robust API support for managing trade execution, setting risk controls and tracking performance.Step 2: Integrating Grok 3 with the trading platformGrok 3 doesn&rsquo;t connect directly to crypto exchanges; integration requires creative workarounds:API integration via automation tools: Platforms like Zapier or Make.com can connect Grok 3&rsquo;s analysis to trading platforms.Custom Python scripts: For tech-savvy traders, Grok 3's insights can be processed through Python scripts that execute trades based on Grok 3&rsquo;s recommendations.No-code automation tools: Services like IFTTT can trigger basic trading actions based on Grok 3&rsquo;s sentiment analysis.Step 3: Defining trading strategies with Grok 3Grok 3&rsquo;s success hinges on well-defined strategies. Unlike traditional bots that rely solely on technical signals, Grok 3 crypto trading bot can combine multiple factors, including:Technical indicators: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.Sentiment analysis: Social media trends, influencer opinions and news headlinesOnchain data: Whale activity, exchange inflows/outflows and large wallet movement.Step 4: Backtesting strategies before live tradingBefore deploying Grok 3&rsquo;s strategy in live markets, backtesting is essential to evaluate its performance. Backtesting can reveal:Accuracy of trade signals: Identify how often Grok 3&rsquo;s suggested trades align with profitable outcomes.False signal detection: Ensure Grok 3 isn&rsquo;t generating excessive buy/sell recommendations in volatile or stagnant marketsRefinement opportunities: Fine-tune conditions such as RSI thresholds, sentiment scores or trade exit conditionsExamples of tools for backtesting include TradingView and CryptoQuant.Step 5: Implementing risk management controlsEven with solid insights, crypto markets are unpredictable. Adding risk controls minimizes potential losses:Stop-loss orders: Automatically exits trades if prices move beyond a set threshold.Position limits: Restricts trade size to reduce exposure in uncertain markets.Trailing stops: Locks in profits during upward trends while minimizing downside risk.Example of risk control prompt: &ldquo;Write a code to handle buying and selling a token with the given parameters, including priority fees, slippage, and a take-profit mechanism.&rdquo;Please note that the output shown above is not complete and is provided for illustration purposes only.Step 6: Ongoing monitoring and strategy refinementGrok 3&rsquo;s strength lies in its adaptability, but it requires ongoing monitoring to ensure optimal results. Regularly review:Performance data: Assess win rates, profit margins and signal accuracy.Market conditions: Adjust strategy if major shifts (e.g., regulatory changes or macroeconomic factors) impact sentiment or momentum.Pro tip: Revisiting Grok 3&rsquo;s prompts regularly can refine strategy outcomes and improve long-term performance.Limitations of Grok 3Despite its strengths, Grok 3 has limitations that traders must consider.&nbsp;Data loss: Crypto trading thrives on accurate and real-time data. However, crypto trading automation with Grok 3 has been reported to lose chunks of data, miscount words and provide incorrect time references, which can be detrimental in a fast-moving market and result in inaccurate signal detection, delayed responses to market events and flawed strategy execution.No direct exchange integration: Unlike purpose-built trading bots, Grok 3 doesn&rsquo;t connect directly to crypto exchanges. Traders must rely on third-party platforms to execute trades.Forgetfulness: One of the biggest frustrations highlighted by some users is Grok 3&rsquo;s &ldquo;retrograde amnesia,&rdquo; when it forgets everything from previous sessions. For crypto traders, this is a nightmare. Imagine building a trading strategy and needing Grok 3 to remember past trends and conversations, only for it to start fresh each session.Bias: Grok 3 may deliver biased responses, potentially relying on incomplete or skewed sources. For traders who depend on unbiased sentiment analysis to gauge market mood, this shift could lead to misleading insights and poor decision-making.Slower execution speed: Since Grok 3 processes information based on detailed prompts, its trade signals may lag behind fast-moving price changes.Prompt dependence: Grok 3&rsquo;s accuracy depends heavily on well-structured prompts. Vague or incomplete instructions often produce unreliable results.While Grok-3 and other AI systems offer powerful tools for automating crypto trades, caution is essential. Their performance depends heavily on the quality of data and the strategies they&rsquo;re programmed with, meaning unexpected market shifts or flawed inputs can lead to significant losses.&nbsp;Remember, AI lacks human intuition and may struggle with unprecedented events, so relying solely on it without oversight is risky. Always test strategies with small amounts first and get help from experts before making large investments.",

    "title": "Hong Kong Regulator Releases Crypto Staking Rules for Licensed Exchanges",
    "content": "Hong Kong's securities regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), laid out new guidance that would allow licensed crypto exchanges and funds to offer staking services in the city.Staking offers crypto holders a way of putting their digital assets to work and earning passive income without selling them. Staking is integral to Proof of Stake (PoS) networks as it provides security and immutability.In a press release on Monday, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) acknowledged the dual role staking can play, enhancing blockchain network security and providing regulated yield-generating opportunities for investors, as it continues to implement its broader strategy of growing Hong Kong's digital asset sector through its \"ASPIRe\" roadmap.\"Broadening the suite of regulated services and products is crucial to sustain the healthy advancement of Hong Kong’s virtual asset ecosystem,\" said Julia Leung, SFC's Chief Executive Officer, in a release. \"But the broadening must be done in a regulated environment where the safety of client virtual assets continues to be front and center.\"In a circular explaining the rules around staking, the SFC said that Virtual Asset Trading Platforms (VATPs), which is what the regulator calls licensed exchanges, must retain complete control of clients' assets, explicitly prohibiting the outsourcing of staking to a third-party.Platforms will also be required to transparently disclose all associated risks, including potential vulnerabilities like blockchain errors, hacking, or validator inactivity.VATPs, according to the rules, must clearly inform clients of the processes involved, fees, minimum lock-up durations, and arrangements for business continuity during disruptions.Authorized virtual asset funds, meanwhile, are mandated to stake only via licensed platforms or authorized institutions, with an enforced cap to manage liquidity risks, further underscoring the regulator's cautious yet supportive approach.This is in contrast to Singapore, Hong Kong's rival financial center in the region, which banned retail staking in 2023, citing the need for \"investor protection.\"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to restrict staking through enforcement actions, though it's facing growing calls from a bipartisan group of senators to ease its stance.Meanwhile, several states, including most recently Illinois, have dropped staking lawsuits against Coinbase, which was first hit with multiple lawsuits in 2023.",

    "title": "Trader stakes $0.05 of SOL for 3,000 years: Here’s what it’ll be worth in 5138",
    "content": "A crypto user has gone very long on Solana, staking a very small portion of the token for the next 3,000 years, according to blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence.The unknown user staked $0.05 Solana (SOL) in 2023, and it will unlock in the year 5138, Arkham said in an April 5 post to X.Speaking to Cointelegraph, Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, said the move was likely a symbolic act reflecting a strong belief and conviction in Solana&rsquo;s long-term ecosystem.Source: Arkham Intelligence&ldquo;Legacy staking is more than locking assets it&rsquo;s a mindset. The real edge in crypto isn&rsquo;t in chasing short-term hype, but in holding long-term conviction assets through cycles,&rdquo; he said.Adding that: &ldquo;this kind of thinking builds not just portfolios, but long term legacies.&rdquo;SOL is currently trading for $102, according to CoinMarketCap. A January report from asset manager Bitwise predicts the token could be worth between $2,300 and over $6,000 by 2030.It's impossible to know what the staked SOL will be worth by the time it&rsquo;s unlocked in a few thousand years, but Liu says it would likely be a significant sum.&ldquo;If SOL appreciates just 2&ndash;5% annually, the compounding over 3,000 years becomes exponential. In any market condition, long-term compounding remains one of the most powerful financial forces,&rdquo; he said.Staking Solana for over 3 millennia To put it into perspective, 5 cents compounded annually at a 3% annual interest rate would already result in over $486 undecillion (486 followed by 36 zeros) after 3,115 years. However, the Solana sum would likely be much higher, given staking rewards are paid out every two to three days and compounded. Users on X are speculating that the stake could be an attempt at creating generational wealth, or a random stunt with no real long-term plan.Source: Arkham IntelligenceKadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer at blockchain platform Komodo, told Cointelegraph he thinks the &ldquo;3,000-year nickel play on SOL is a meme trade&rdquo; that will one day be stamped on the SOL blockchain.Related: Solana TVL hits new high in SOL terms, DEX volumes show strength &mdash; Will SOL price react?&ldquo;What will 3,000 years from now look like? Will humans still be around? Will the Solana blockchain? Such a long time horizon makes one ponder one&rsquo;s place in the scheme of things,&rdquo; Stadelmann said.&nbsp;&nbsp;He speculates people might even seek to outdo it by &ldquo;making a 5,000-year play.&rdquo;At the moment, depending on the platform and validator choice, Solana can offer between 5% to over 8% in staking rewards. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) can start at around 2%, and Ether (ETH)&nbsp;staking rewards are usually between 2% and 7%.Four Solana whales recently profited over $200 million in a staking play that began in April 2021, when they staked 1.79 million Solana, worth $37.7 million at the time.&nbsp;A similar unlock is expected in 2028.&nbsp;Magazine: Bitcoin heading to $70K soon?

    "content": "Crypto majors are reeling from a wave of volatility, with XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) plunging below key technical support levels early on Monday.Macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from a global tariff war — dubbed an “economic nuclear war\" by hedge fund manager Bill Ackman — is reeling markets from crypto to global equities, with bitcoin under $79,000 and major tokens down 14%.XRP Price AnalysisXRP, which powers the XRP Ledger, slipped to $1.90 with a 14%. On the daily chart, XRP has breached its critical support at $2.00 — a level that previously held firm as psychological and technical bedrock. This breakdown completes a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, a signal of potential further downside.Technical indicators reinforce the bearish outlook. The 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) sits at $2.20, acting as a resistance after XRP failed to reclaim it in past weeks. The relative strength index (RSI) has dipped into negative territory, hovering near 30, suggesting selling pressure outweighs buying interest.ADA Price AnalysisCardano’s ADA token trades at 55 cents, down 12% in the past 24 hours, below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA), a critical support that had propped up the price since mid-March. This breach on the daily chart aligns with a broader descending triangle pattern, hinting at continued bearish control.The RSI for ADA sits at 38, teetering on the edge of oversold territory, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a bearish crossover, with the signal line dipping below the MACD line.The next support lies at nearly 35 cents, a level tested in late 2024, but a break below could drag ADA toward $0.40, a 30% drop from current levels.Bulls would need to reclaim 60 cents and flip it into support to negate the bearish thesis, though macroeconomic headwinds — fueled by tariff threats and a 20% crypto market cap loss this year — make that a tall order.DOGE Price AnalysisMemecoin darling dogecoin (DOGE) has tumbled to $0.16, down nearly 15% in the last 24 hours. It sliced through support at 18 cents, a level that marked the base of a consolidation range since early March.On the 4-hour chart, a death cross has emerged, with the 50-period SMA crossing below the 200-period SMA, signaling a potential trend reversal to the downside.The RSI for DOGE is deep in oversold territory at 28, hinting at possible short-term relief, but the 20-day EMA at $0.21 looms as a stiff resistance. If bears maintain control, DOGE could sink to $0.14, aligning with its December 2024 lows.",

    "content": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) will likely see a reduced role in crypto regulations as other federal agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and state-level regulators assume a bigger role in crypto policy, according to Ethan Ostroff, partner at the Troutman Pepper Locke law firm.&ldquo;I think with the current administration, my sense is, we are highly likely to see a significant pullback by the CFPB in the context of the activity by other regulators,&rdquo; Ostroff told Cointelegraph in an interview.State regulators also have the authority under the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) to assume some of the regulatory roles of the CFPB, the attorney said, but he also added that some regulatory functions will continue to fall within the purview of the CFPB as a matter of established law.Ostroff cited the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) as regulators to keep an eye on as potential leaders of crypto regulations at the state level.However, the attorney clarified that while the CFPB may see a diminished role during the Trump administration, the agency would not be outright dismantled during the current regime due to &ldquo;statutorily mandated obligations and requirements&rdquo; that require acts of Congress to change.Related: Elon Musk&rsquo;s &lsquo;government efficiency&rsquo; team turns its sights to SEC &mdash; ReportTrump administration targets CFPB in efficiency pushThe Trump administration targeted the CFPB as part of a broader push by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to slash government spending and reduce the federal debt.Russell Vought, the recently appointed head of the CFPB, announced major funding cuts to the agency and scaled back operations within days of assuming the helm at the CFPB in February 2025.Source: Russell VoughtMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized Elon Musk for dismantling the CFPB, which the US senator co-founded back in 2007.Warren characterized Musk as a &ldquo;bank robber&rdquo; and claimed that the Trump administration dismantled the CFPB to undo consumer protection rules and have greater control over the financial system.In a Feb. 12 interview with Mother Jones, the senator stressed that the Executive Branch of government does not have the statutory authority to fully dismantle the CFPB, which can only be done through Congressional approval.Magazine: SEC&rsquo;s U-turn on crypto leaves key questions unanswered",

    "title": "Bitcoin Posts Worst Q1 in a Decade, Raising Questions About Where the Cycle Stands",
    "content": "Bitcoin just notched its worst first quarter in a decade, falling 11.7% as markets struggled to understand the new administration’s economic agenda. The performance ranked 12th out of the past 15 first quarters, according to NYDIG Research's data.The drawdown invites a familiar question in crypto circles: is the cycle over? The last time bitcoin started the year this poorly was in 2015, during a prolonged slump following the 2013 peak and after the collapse of Mt. Gox, according to NYDIG. Back then, prices recovered modestly over the rest of the year before surging in 2016.In the first quarter of 2020, amid a market sell-off tied to fears surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, BTC saw a 9.4% drawdown but then recovered to end the year up over 300%. In other years with negative Q1 returns—like 2014, 2018 and 2022—bitcoin ended the year down sharply, coinciding with the tail ends of previous bull cycles, the research note said. This time around, the backdrop is murky. Cryptocurrency prices surged after Donald Trump won the U.S. election in November after running a pro-crypto campaign. While under the Trump administration, the sector has been gaining greater regulatory clarity, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) backed off a number of lawsuits against crypto firms, it isn’t all bullish.Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariffs against nearly every country in the world last week, leading to a massive $5.4 trillion U.S. equities market wipeout in just two days. This led to the S&P 500 index's lowest level in 11 months and the Nasdaq 100's entry into bear market territory. While bitcoin has outperformed so far, what will happen after Monday’s opening bell is unclear.Historically, a weak Q1 doesn’t always spell doom for BTC, NYDIG’s data shows. The asset has bounced back in half of the years when it started in the red. The recent macroeconomic backdrop has seen analysts raise recession odds, which could test BTC’s role as a “U.S. isolation hedge.” Read more: Chart of The Week: Will April Bring Good Luck or Fool's Hope for Bitcoin?",

    "content": "Opinion by: Daryl Xu, co-founder and CEO, NPC LabsWhile gaming has been on a steady decline since the end of COVID-19 lockdowns, 2024 hit the industry especially hard, with layoffs and studio closures hitting even the most prominent studios.&nbsp;While unsustainable development costs and an innovation crisis seem to be the main culprits behind the collapse, Web3 gaming emerged as a potential solution promising to return power to developers &mdash; and it raised billions of dollars in investment to do so.&nbsp;Yet, despite a continued rise in crypto adoption, Web3 gaming has failed to capture mainstream players&rsquo; attention or solve any of gaming&rsquo;s fundamental problems. Why? Early blockchains were designed for financial applications. Game developers were forced to either build on blockchains that weren&rsquo;t designed for their use or create their own chains that isolated themselves from the blockchain ecosystem. Either choice led to poor player experience and an overemphasis on tokenomics.&nbsp;Many developers choose the latter, picking control over connectivity. Inadvertently, this resulted in walled gardens that were not dissimilar to the ones that contributed to traditional gaming&rsquo;s collapse.A solution that created more problemsA recent article in The New York Times revealed that over the last 30 or 40 years, video game industry executives have bet on better graphics to bring in players and profits rather than leaning on creativity. Traditional gaming development is costly, regularly exceeding $100 million per title. Indie developers often struggle to compete against large publishers who ultimately control funding and distribution.Blockchain seemed to be a promising solution for indie studios, providing them with new avenues to raise funds and giving them control over distribution. Early Web3 gaming platforms, however, ended up recreating the same enclosed systems that blockchain was trying to fix. With high player acquisition costs and limited Web3 gamers, Web3 gaming platforms deepened their moats to prevent users from moving away. As it continued developing, Web3 gaming introduced its own problems.&nbsp;An impossible choice for game developersThe technological infrastructures of layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum and Solana were created for finance and not aligned with gaming&rsquo;s requirements. Beyond transaction speed, layer-2 solutions were not designed to handle gaming&rsquo;s unique needs either.Game developers &mdash; attracted to Web3&rsquo;s funding model, promises of ownership and user engagement, are forced to either build on existing blockchains and compromise gameplay or launch their own chain &mdash; which diverts attention and resources away from what they want to do: make better games.&nbsp;Recent: Web3 gaming investors no longer throwing money at &lsquo;Axie killers&rsquo;While crypto native players may feel this is a worthwhile tradeoff, mainstream gamers want engaging experiences. A January DappRadar report showed that Web3 gaming had reached 7.3 million unique active wallets, but&nbsp; in speaking with the community anecdotally, approximately 10,000 of those represent the actual gaming cohort who aren&rsquo;t in games just to farm rewards. This number may be higher but is not more than 50,000 to 100,000 at the most.A misalignment with gaming cultureThe thing that converts mainstream users onchain isn&rsquo;t non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or decentralized finance, its meaningful ownership of in-asset games. Mainstream gamers have spent decades on arcade games, Nintendo or mobile games. If combined with true ownership of in-game assets, that familiarity is powerful enough to create a compelling experience for developers and gamers.While Web3 games claim to be revolutionizing gaming, most projects aren&rsquo;t listening to actual gamers. In actuality, they end up competing for the same crypto-native users. Rather than focusing on fun and engaging gameplay, most Web3 games are led by crypto technology and tokenomics. Within this bubble, success in Web3 gaming meant taking crypto users from each other rather than bringing new players onchain.&nbsp;With rare exceptions, the industry lost sight of what&rsquo;s important: making fun games that people want to play.This misalignment also extends to game developers who want to enter Web3 to create better player experiences and sustainable revenue models. Game studios understand the potentials of Web3 but are hesitant to navigate crypto&rsquo;s complex systems, which require technical skills to build protocols with sufficient liquidity and user bases while delivering seamless gameplay simultaneously.Make games fun againAs major studios continue to struggle, Web3 has a second chance to deliver on its promise. But this time, we must rethink how games interact. We must focus on creating access for creators and players instead of building new walled gardens. This requires Web3 gaming-specific infrastructure that provides both developer control and cross-ecosystem collaboration.&nbsp;The path forward is clear. We need to restore economic freedom to creators and put control back in players&rsquo; hands. That means revenue models that reward collaboration instead of isolation. Most importantly, it means returning to gaming&rsquo;s roots &mdash; making games fun again.&nbsp;The future of gaming isn&rsquo;t about better graphics or token incentives. It&rsquo;s about creating an industry where creativity and collaboration can thrive. When developers can focus on making engaging experiences instead of building moats, everyone wins.Opinion by: Daryl Xu, co-founder and CEO, NPC Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The S&P 500 lost more than $5 trillion, its largest drop on record, surpassing the pandemic-induced crash in March 2020, according to Reuters.Still, some analysts see a silver lining to the tariff announcement.&ldquo;In my opinion, the tariffs are the representation of the uncertainty in the markets,&rdquo; Micha&euml;l van de Poppe, founder of MN Consultancy, told Cointelegraph. &ldquo;Liberation Day is basically the peak of that period, the climax of uncertainty.

This IEI/HYG ratio, highlighted by analyst Caleb Franzen, serves as a proxy for credit spreads and is now showing its sharpest spike since the Silicon Valley Bank crisis in March 2023 — a moment that marked a local bottom in bitcoin just below $20,000.Historically, bitcoin and other risk assets tend to fall during sharp credit spread expansions. The key question now is whether this surge has peaked or if more downside lies ahead. If spreads continue to rise, it could reflect mounting stress in financial markets — and spell further trouble for risk-on positioning.A credit spread represents the yield difference between safe government bonds and riskier corporate bonds. When spreads widen, it signals growing risk aversion and tightening financial conditions. However, Friday's market action seems to indicate that bitcoin is starting to decouple from the traditional markets, outperforming equities. One analyst event called it the new \"U.S. isolation hedge,\" indicating that BTC might be starting to act more like a safe haven or digital gold for TradFi investors.

    "content": "Bitcoin's (BTC) recent stability amid Nasdaq turmoil driven by tariffs has generated excitement among market participants regarding the cryptocurrency's potential as a haven asset. Still, the bulls might want to keep an eye on the bond market, where dynamics that characterized the COVID crash of March 2020 may be emerging.Nasdaq, Wall Street's tech-heavy index known to be positively correlated to bitcoin, has dropped 11% since President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced reciprocal tariffs on 180 nations, escalating trade tensions and drawing retaliatory levies from China. Other U.S. indices and global markets have also taken a beating alongside sharp losses in the risk currencies like the Australian dollar and a pullback in gold.BTC has largely remained stable, continuing to trade above $80,000, and its resilience is being viewed as a sign of its evolution into a macro hedge.\"The S&P 500 is down roughly 5% this week as investors brace for trade-driven earnings headwinds. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has shown impressive resilience,\" David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at 21Shares, told CoinDesk in an email. \"After briefly dipping below $82,000, it rebounded quickly, reinforcing its status as a macro hedge in times of macroeconomic stress. Its relative strength could continue to attract institutional inflows if broad market volatility persists.\" The perception of stability could quickly transform into a self-fulfilling prophecy, solidifying BTC's position as a haven asset for years to come, as MacroScope noted on X. Treasury basis trade risksHowever, sharp downside volatility in the short term cannot be ruled out, especially as the \"Treasury market basis trade\" faces risks due to heightened turbulence in bond prices.The basis trade involves highly leveraged hedge funds, reportedly operating at leverage ratios of 50-to-1, exploiting minor price discrepancies between Treasury futures and securities. This trade blew up in mid-March 2020 as coronavirus threatened to derail the global economy, leading to a \"dash for cash\" that saw investors sell almost every asset for dollar liquidity. On March 12, 2020, BTC fell by nearly 40%.\"When market volatility spikes - as it is now - it unearths highly leveraged carry trades vulnerable to big market moves. The blowup in the US Treasury market in March 2020, which disrupted basis carry trades, is a recent example. Risk of leveraged carry trade blowups is high...,\" Robin Brooks, managing director and chief economist at the International Institute of Finance,\" said on X. The risk is real because, the size of the basis trade as of March end was $1 trillion, double the tally in March 2020. The positioning is such that a one basis point move in Treasury yields (which move opposite to prices) would lead to a $600 million shift in the value of their bets, according to ZeroHedge.So, increased volatility in the Treasury yields could cause a COVID-like blowup, leading to a widespread selling of all assets, including bitcoin, to obtain cash.On Friday, the MOVE index, which represents the options-based implied or expected 30-day volatility in the U.S. Treasury market, jumped 12% to 125.70, the highest since Nov. 4, according to data source TradingView.The gravity of the situation is underscored by a recent Brookings Institution paper, which advises the Federal Reserve to consider targeted interventions in the U.S. Treasury market, specifically supporting hedge funds engaged in basis trading during times of severe market stress.Let's see how things unfold in the week ahead.",

    "content": "Solana&rsquo;s native token SOL (SOL) dropped by 9% between March 28 and April 4, but several key metrics grew during the same period. Despite SOL&rsquo;s price downturn, the Solana network continues to outpace competitors, maintaining its second-place position in deposits and trading volume. Traders now wonder how long it will take for SOL&rsquo;s price to reflect this onchain strength.Solana outperforms rivals in TVL deposits and DEX volumesInvestor&rsquo;s declining interest in SOL could be linked to the April 4 staking unlock of 1.79 million SOL, worth over $200 million. The selling pressure is clear, as these tokens were staked in April 2021, when SOL traded near $23. Another factor is the decline in interest for memecoins, which had been a major driver of new user adoption on Solana. With fewer speculative inflows, growth in activity may not translate to immediate price gains.Several meme-themed cryptocurrencies, including WIF, PENGU, POPCAT, AI16Z, BOME, and ACT, saw declines of 20% or more over the past seven days. Yet, despite worsening market conditions, the Solana network outperformed some competitors. Its total value locked (TVL) rose to the highest level since June 2022, while decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes showed notable resilience.Solana Total Vale Locked (TVL), SOL. Source: DefiLlamaDeposits in Solana network&rsquo;s DApps rose to 53.8 million SOL on April 2, marking a 14% increase from the previous month. In US dollar terms, the $6.5 billion total stands $780 million ahead of its closest competitor, BNB Chain. Solana&rsquo;s top DApps by TVL include Jito (liquid staking), Jupiter (leading DEX), and Kamino (lending and liquidity platform).Solana gains support for scalability and Web3 focus despite MEV concernsWhile not yet a direct threat to Ethereum&rsquo;s $50 billion TVL, Solana&rsquo;s onchain data shows greater resilience compared to BNB Chain, Tron, and Ethereum layer-2 networks like Base and Arbitrum. In decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, Solana holds a 24% market share, while BNB Chain accounts for 12% and Base captures 10%, according to data from DefiLlama.DEX volumes monthly market share. Source: DefiLlamaWhile Ethereum has regained the lead in DEX volumes, Solana has shown strong resilience following the memecoin bubble burst. For context, Raydium&rsquo;s weekly volumes dropped 95% from the $42.9 billion all-time high reached in mid-January. Still, Solana has demonstrated that traders appreciate its focus on base layer scalability and integrated Web3 user experience despite ongoing criticism related to maximum extractable value (MEV).Source: Cbb0feIn short, MEV occurs when validators reorder transactions for profit. This practice is not unique to Solana, but some market participants&mdash;such as user Cbb0fe, a self-proclaimed decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity provider&mdash;have raised concerns about insider gatekeeping. While not stated directly, the criticism likely refers to incentives provided by Solana Labs to offset the high investment and maintenance costs required by certain validators.Supporters of changing Solana&rsquo;s token emissions argue that rewards earned through MEV already provide sufficient incentives for validators to secure the network, eliminating the need for further inflationary pressure on SOL. Meanwhile, Loring Harkness, a core contributor to Shutter Network, advocates for encrypting transactions before they enter the mempool as a way to prevent validators from manipulating their order.Solana&rsquo;s growth in TVL and resilience in DEX market share may not be enough for SOL to retest the $200 level seen in mid-February. However, it has firmly secured its second-place position behind Ethereum as a leading platform for decentralized applications, supported by consistent activity, infrastructure development, and growing interest from both developers and users.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Let&rsquo;s examine these catalysts in detail.XRP nears a classic technical breakdown XRP's recent price action is flashing a classic bearish reversal signal dubbed &ldquo;inverse cup and handle formation.&rdquo;The inverse cup and handle is a bearish chart pattern that signals fading buyer momentum after an uptrend.

The ongoing sideways price movement between $2.05 and $2.20 forms the &ldquo;handle.&rdquo;XRP/USD four-hour price chart.

A breakdown below this high-volume area could trigger a sharper drop, as lower volume levels below have offered little historical support in recent history.XRP/USD four-hour price chart. Source: TradingViewConversely, a strong close above the 50-period 4-hour EMA (red line) near $2.14 could invalidate the inverse cup-and-handle pattern.

    "title": "Bitcoin Developer Proposes Hard Fork to Protect BTC From Quantum Computing Threats",
    "content": "Bitcoin could be headed for its most sweeping cryptographic overhaul yet if a new proposal gains traction.A draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) titled Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol (QRAMP) has been introduced by developer Agustin Cruz. It outlines a plan to enforce a network-wide migration of BTC from legacy wallets to ones secured by post-quantum cryptography.Quantum computing involves moving away from a process reliant on binary code, ones and zeros, and exponentially increasing computing power by employing Quantum bits (qubits) that exist in multiple states simultaneously. Such a jump in power is expected to threaten modern computing encryption built by classic machines.The proposal suggests that after a predetermined block height, nodes running the updated software would reject any transaction trying to spend coins from an address using ECDSA cryptography, which could theoretically make it vulnerable to quantum attacks.A hard fork debateBitcoin currently relies on algorithms, including SHA-256 for mining and the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for signatures. Per Cruz, legacy addresses that haven’t yet transacted are protected by additional layers, while those that have exposed their public keys—necessary to conduct transactions—may now be vulnerable “if sufficiently powerful quantum computers emerge.”The move would require a hard fork, which is likely going to be a tall ask from the community. A hard fork refers to a change to a blockchain that renders an older version incompatible.\"I admire the effort but this will still leave everyone who doesn't migrate's coins vunerable, including Satoshi's coins,\" said one Reddit user about the new proposal. \"Bitcoin could implement a post quantum security for all coins but that would need a hard fork, which due to bitcoin's history and the mantra repeated by maxis that would create a new coin and would not be bitcoin anymore.\"Read more: The Blocksize Wars Revisited: How Bitcoin’s Civil War Still Resonates TodayPreventive measureThe proposed solution sets a migration deadline to lock those funds unless they’re moved to a more secure wallet. This proposal isn’t a response to any imminent breakthrough in quantum computing. Instead, it's a preventive measure, yet it comes a little over a month after Microsoft unveiled Majorana 1, a quantum processing unit designed to scale to a million qubits per chip.During a migration window, users would still be able to move funds freely. The BIP calls for wallet developers, block explorers and “other infrastructure” to build tools and warnings to help users comply. After the deadline, non-upgraded nodes could fork from the network if they continue accepting legacy transactions.This is not the first time someone has suggested a mechanism to defend Bitcoin from quantum computing threats. Most recently, BTQ, a startup working to build blockchain technology that can withstand attacks from quantum computers, has proposed an alternative to the Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm involving quantum technology.In its research paper, BTQ proposed a method called Coarse-Grained Boson Sampling (CGBS). This process uses light particles (bosons) to generate unique patterns—samples—that reflect the blockchain’s current state instead of hash-based mathematical puzzles.However, this proposal would also require a hard fork involving miners and nodes replacing their existing ASIC-based hardware with quantum-ready infrastructure.Read more: Quantum Startup BTQ Proposes More Energy Efficient Alternative to Crypto's Proof of Work",

    "title": "Utility, volatility and longevity: Looking beyond the hype",
    "content": "Opinion by: James Newman, chief corporate affairs officer at ChilizThe perception of blockchain, especially for those outside the industry, has often been driven primarily by stories of extreme volatility, bad actors and speculation.&nbsp;In past months, the industry has been dominated by the narratives around the rise and subsequent fall of memecoins like HAWK, Fartcoin and LIBRA. Rewind to 2021, and lacking a genuine use case, the massive hype around non-fungible tokens (NFTs) failed to translate to long-term success, with the average NFT project today having a lifespan 2.5 times shorter than the average crypto project.&nbsp;For many, however, the appeal of these assets lies in their volatility, turning a few dollars into a fortune overnight. While NFTs and memecoins are undeniably part of Web3 culture, what sustains projects, keeps users engaged, and drives the industry forward is not volatility but providing genuine solutions to real-world problems. Ultimately, it&rsquo;s about utility.&nbsp;Utility drives stability&nbsp;Many blockchain projects fail because they are solutions searching for a problem rather than solving an existing one. Assets that offer no utility at all are unlikely to be more than a flash-in-the-pan moment of volatile speculation. While digital assets continue pushing technological innovation&rsquo;s boundaries, human needs for utility and tangible value remain constant. Moreover, a digital asset&rsquo;s utility promotes stability by shifting focus away from short-term speculation to meaningful engagement.&nbsp;When assessing the stability of a digital asset, its longevity is far more telling than short-term price swings. Volatility is inherent in crypto, but the accurate measure of resilience is whether a project can endure across market cycles. Fan tokens have demonstrated this stability, whereas NFTs &mdash; despite their initial boom &mdash; have struggled mainly to maintain long-term value beyond speculative hype.&nbsp;While memecoins certainly generate hype, their longevity is fleeting. 97% of memecoins launched in 2024 have already failed. There are exceptions, of course, but the overwhelming majority don&rsquo;t stand the test of time.In contrast, sports clubs have been issuing fan tokens since 2018, weathering both bull and bear markets. Their resilience comes from utility &mdash; fan tokens continuously evolve to reimagine fan engagement, bringing fans and clubs closer together.&nbsp;Solve problems, create value, establish longevity&nbsp;The connection between utility and stability is clear. Digital assets that solve real-world problems foster sustainable adoption. Instead of attracting speculators hoping for quick profits, utility-driven assets bring in users with a genuine need for or interest in the project.The rise of stablecoins underscores the importance of utility.&nbsp;Recent: Fan tokens offer stability &mdash; NFTs have notOver the past six months, stablecoin market capitalization has grown from $160 billion to $230 billion. According to DeSpread Research, in 2021, there were 27 stablecoins. By July 2024, there were 182, representing a 574% growth rate over three years. The reason? Stablecoins provide users real utility, whether you&rsquo;re a small business owner looking to transact across borders or a developer looking for liquidity for your decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol.Another indicator of an asset&rsquo;s utility is institutional adoption. To put it bluntly, BlackRock invests in Bitcoin (BTC). It offers BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) &mdash; not Fartcoin &mdash; because institutions prioritize assets with a proven track record of creating tangible value for their customers over short-lived, hype-filled speculation.For sports fans, emotional connections to their teams run deep &mdash; even if they&rsquo;ve never set foot in their team&rsquo;s stadium. Fan tokens fill this gap and tap into this emotional connection by offering more ways for fans to engage with their teams through direct participation and rewards &mdash; no matter where they are in the world.&nbsp;Whether voting on team decisions, accessing exclusive deals, staking fan tokens for additional perks or simply owning a piece of their team&rsquo;s digital identity, fan tokens provide utility through their lifecycle.&nbsp;The future of digital assetsTo bring it full circle, Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s original vision for Bitcoin was to solve a problem: an unfair financial system. 16 years later, despite the many applications of blockchain technology, this remains the reality of the asset.The future of digital assets will be defined by their ability to solve real-world problems, which is recognized by the clubs themselves. This is why they don&rsquo;t just issue fan tokens &mdash; they actively grant their IP rights to strengthen trust and credibility in the asset. When some of the world&rsquo;s most iconic sports brands embrace blockchain technology this way, it&rsquo;s a clear signal that the next era of fan engagement isn&rsquo;t on the horizon &mdash; it&rsquo;s already here. And we&rsquo;re only just getting started.Beyond fan tokens, blockchain is transforming the sports industry across multiple dimensions, with each use case becoming increasingly interconnected. Take Tether&rsquo;s recent investment in Juventus. The surge in the price of Juventus&rsquo; fan token underscores how deeply blockchain and crypto intersect across investment, sponsorship and fan engagement. With crypto sponsorships in sports surging in 2024, this convergence will only accelerate as clubs, leagues and brands explore new ways to harness Web3 technology &mdash; creating richer, more interactive fan experiences while unlocking new revenue streams.Opinion by: James Newman, chief corporate affairs officer at Chiliz.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

    "title": "Why OFAC Delisted Tornado Cash",
    "content": "Last month, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control delisted Tornado Cash from its sanctions list, months after an appeals court ruled that the watchdog could not designate the mixer's smart contracts.You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.Fair windsThe narrativeIn November 2024, a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled that the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) couldn't sanction smart contracts tied to crypto mixer Tornado Cash. Last month, OFAC delisted Tornado Cash entirely, though it left developer Roman Semenov on its Specially Designated Nationals list.Why it mattersWhether Tornado Cash could be sanctioned to begin with has been a point of contention for the crypto industry. The Fifth Circuit ruling sparked a rally in the TORN token's price and raised hopes that it would be more difficult for the U.S. government to block legal uses of mixers.Breaking it downTornado Cash's delisting included smart contract addresses and other components of the overall mixer, and followed November's ruling. The delisting may have been an effort to preempt a court ruling that would force OFAC to permanently delist Tornado Cash.Backing up a little: A group of developers sued OFAC after Tornado Cash was first sanctioned with backing from crypto exchange Coinbase. That case, Van Loon v. Treasury, received an initial ruling from a district court judge that was favorable to the Treasury Department. On appeal, however, the Fifth Circuit ruled — somewhat narrowly — that smart contracts were outside the scope of OFAC's jurisdiction. The appeals court panel threw the case back down to the district court to sort out next steps.On March 21, the same day it removed Tornado Cash from its sanctions list, OFAC filed a notice telling the court that the removal meant the legal case remedies cot \"the matter is now moot.\"Peter Van Valkenburgh, the executive director at Coin Center, said the November decision left OFAC with few options.\"They could have waited for the court to invalidate the sanctions or they could have delisted them themselves, and they delisted themselves,\" he said. \"You can read that two ways. You can read that as 'I want to try and preserve some ability to fight in the future or [make] some other listing,' [and] that's really tough because that Fifth Circuit opinion is really bad for them.\"The other read for the delisting is OFAC just wanted the matter resolved quickly, he said.Leah Moushey, an attorney with Miller & Chevalier, said the court may choose to reject OFAC's filing because there's an open question as to whether Tornado Cash can be redesignated in the future. She pointed to a Supreme Court case with thematic similarities.The court said in that case, FBI v.

After the Fifth Circuit ruling, Storm's attorneys filed a motion asking the judge overseeing the criminal case to dismiss the indictment, but the judge has already ruled that the case should move forward.\"The judge determined that the scope of the conduct went beyond the interactions with the smart contract,\" Moushey said. The Fifth Circuit ruling did not discuss Tornado Cash as an entity.Van Valkenburgh noted that OFAC left its sanctions against Semenov in place, and the DOJ will continue to try and argue Storm conspired to violate sanctions.The Storm case is currently set for trial in July.Stories you may have missedIllinois to Drop Staking Lawsuit Against Coinbase: Illinois has become the latest state to announce it would drop its lawsuit against Coinbase, joining Kentucky, Vermont and South Carolina.

    "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has no business with certain stablecoins or their issuers, the regulator's staff declared in the latest statement outlining the corners of the crypto sector for which it doesn't have a legal interest.Since the agency was taken over by President Donald Trump-appointed leadership and formed a Crypto Task Force to ease pressures on the digital assets space, its staff has issued a series of statements meant to clarify the crypto areas outside its jurisdiction — so far including memecoins and proof-of-work crypto mining. It's now added certain stablecoins to that list. The SEC's Division of Corporation Finance issued the Friday statement — not yet a binding rule, or even formal guidance — to declare such stablecoins \"do not involve the offer and sale of securities.\"\"Persons involved in the process of 'minting' (or creating) and redeeming Covered Stablecoins do not need to register those transactions with the Commission under the Securities Act or fall within one of the Securities Act’s exemptions from registration,\" according to the statement.It went on to clarify that such stablecoins — an arena dominated by Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC — \"are marketed solely for use in commerce, as a means of making payments, transmitting money, and/or storing value, and not as investments.\"However, the stablecoins covered by this statement may not include Tether's, because one of the footnotes says acceptable reserves \"do not include precious metals or other crypto assets,\" both of which are included in Tether's reserves. And the statement says any tokens must be redeemable at any time for dollars, but Tether's terms of service suggest minimum amounts or delays may be imposed. Circle President Heath Tarbert posted a social-media comment that included a jab toward its competitors. \"The SEC just drew a clear line: Stablecoins backed one-for-one with high quality liquid assets —l ike USDC — are NOT securities,\" Tarbert said. \"This certainty does not extend to other digital assets just because they call themselves 'stablecoins.'\"Congress has been moving forward on establishing a new set of U.S. standards for the issuance of such tokens. This week, the House Financial Services Committee advanced a stablecoin bill toward a vote of the overall House of Representatives. The Senate is building toward consideration of a similar bill that's also been approved by committee there — in both cases by a wide, bipartisan vote.While they're the most sedate of crypto assets, stablecoins have been a colorful political topic in recent weeks, as the Trump-backed World Liberty Financial pitched its own stablecoin, and some congressional Democrats are concerned that Elon Musk will leverage his status as a tech giant to follow suit.SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who is leading the agency's task force, has said she feels the early, nonbinding moves to reverse crypto resistance at the SEC are important and should be done as rapidly as possible, even if they're not yet official policy. She's said non-fungible tokens (NFTS) may also be considered for such a statement.

The Senate Banking Committee approved his nomination in a party-line vote this week.Even before his arrival, interim Chairman Mark Uyeda has made dramatic moves to overhaul the regulator's crypto position. That's included throwing out most of the prominent enforcement cases the agency had pursued against digital assets businesses, though a few remain.UPDATE (April 4, 2025, 20:52 UTC): Adds information on Tether's token being potentially left out.

    "content": "Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2025 with our curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out The Crunchbase Megadeals Board.\n\nThis is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out the biggest funding rounds of last week here.\n\nThis was a week right out of the free-spending days of 2021. Huge rounds were abundant — led by the biggest of them all as OpenAI’s massive $40 billion investment was finally announced.\n\n1. OpenAI, $40B, artificial intelligence: Of course the big news of the week was the $40 billion investment for OpenAI led by SoftBank. The deal is the biggest venture investment ever. Per details of the deal, SoftBank will build a syndicate of co-investors to provide $10 billion of the total, while it expects to fund the other $30 billion, with  $10 billion of that through debt. The deal also is partially contingent upon conditions of OpenAI’s restructuring of its for-profit subsidiary. If that occurs, OpenAI will have a post-money valuation of $300 billion.\n\n2. Plaid, $575M, fintech: Plaid raised a massive $575 million round led by Franklin Templeton at a $6.1 billion valuation. The San Francisco-based company plans to use the cash to pay employee tax withholding obligations related to share conversion and to offer some liquidity to employees via a tender offer. Plaid, which connects user bank accounts to fintech apps, had a planned $5.3 billion sale to Visa scrapped back in 2021 following regulatory issues.\n\n3. Silicon Ranch, $500M, energy: Nashville, Tennessee-based Silicon Ranch raised $500 million from European infrastructure investor AIP Management. The big investment is likely a bet on the U.S.’ increasing electricity demands. Silicon Ranch — which operates solar and battery projects — has been on this list before. Back in 2022, the company raised $775 million in equity capital led by Manulife Investment Management. Founded in 2011, the energy company has raised more than $2 billion, according to Crunchbase data.\n\n4. Runway, $308M, artificial intelligence: New York-based Runway raised $308 million in a new round at about double its valuation from less than two years ago. The new round — led by General Atlantic — values the AI video startup at more than $3 billion, per reports. In June 2023, the company raised a $141 million extension to its December 2022 $50 million Series C. Runway makes software that lets users create videos using text prompts or images. Earlier in the week, Runway unveiled its new AI model, Gen-4, that allows users to create videos with consistent characters and backgrounds. Last fall, the company signed a deal with production company LionsGate to create a customized video-generation model. The startup plans to use the fresh cash to develop AI focusing on its film and animation studio. Founded in 2018, it has raised more than $540 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n5. AIRNA, $155M, biotech: Cambridge, Massachusetts-based AIRNA, a biotech startup developing RNA editing therapeutics to help with both rare and common conditions, closed a $155 million Series B led by Forbion Capital Partners and Venrock Healthcare Capital Partners. The new cash will go toward launching a phase trial for AIRNA’s drug candidate for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and help it develop its pipeline of RNA editing therapeutics. Founded in 2021, the company has raised $245 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n6. (tied) Atsena Therapeutics, $150M, biotech: Atsena Therapeutics, a gene therapy company focused on reversing or preventing blindness, closed a $150 million Series C led by Bain Capital’s Life Sciences arm. The money from the financing will be used to advance the Durham, North Carolina-based company’s treatment of X-linked retinoschisis, a genetic condition that is typically diagnosed in childhood and leads to blindness later in life. The proceeds will also support Atsena’s preclinical pipeline. Founded in 2019, the company has raised nearly $238 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n6. (tied) SandboxAQ, $150M, quantum computing: Alphabet spinoff SandboxAQ — an AI and quantum computing startup — added another $150 million to its Series E from the likes Google and Nvidia. The add-on comes less than four months after the company announced it had raised a $300 million round at a $5.6 billion valuation. SandboxAQ is looking at the related effects of both AI and quantum — which is where the company gets “AQ” — to develop commercial products for telecom, financial services, health care, security and other computationally intensive sectors. The company already is working with a handful of customers on enterprise software and cybersecurity tools related to quantum computing. In March 2022, Alphabet officially spun off its 6-year-old quantum tech group — SandboxAQ — which emerged as its own company after closing a $500 million financing round and naming former Google CEO Eric Schmidt chairman. SandboxAQ has raised over $950 million, per the company.\n\n8. Temporal Technologies, $146M, software: Seattle-based Temporal Technologies locked up a big $146 million Series C at a $1.7 billion valuation led by Tiger Global Management. The company helps other companies manage complex software applications and will use the new cash to develop cloud products and invest in research and development for artificial intelligence use. The company raised a $103 million Series B in February 2022 at a valuation of a little more than $1.5 billion, followed by $75 million in a Series “B-Prime.” Founded in 2019, Temporal has raised $350 million, per the company.\n\n9. RayThera, $110M, biotech: San Diego-based RayThera, a biotechnology company currently focused on developing small molecule therapies in immunology, completed a $110 million Series A financing co-led by Foresite Capital and OrbiMed. This is the company’s first raise, per Crunchbase.\n\n10. Neurona Therapeutics, $102M, biotech: Neurona Therapeutics, a South San Francisco-based clinical-stage biotech company developing regenerative cell therapies for disorders of the nervous system, raised a $102 million financing round. Investors included Fidelity Management & Research Co. Founded in 2008, the company has raised $426 million, per Crunchbase.\nBig global deals\n\nThe biggest raise this week came from across the pond.\n\nGoogle spinoff Isomorphic Labs raised $600 million in its first external funding round as the company looks to apply artificial intelligence to the drug development process. The new round was led by Thrive Capital with participation from Google Ventures. The London-based AI company will receive follow-on capital from existing investor Alphabet.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of March 29 to April 4. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

They could readily be used to identify vulnerable targets, hijack their systems, and steal valuable data from unsuspecting victims.\n\nAt present, cybercriminals are not deploying AI agents to hack at scale.

    "title": "The Great Venture Talent Flux",
    "content": "By Rohit Yadav \n\nWhen is the right moment to shift your company, your role, or even your entire industry?\n\nAsk a dozen people, and you’ll get a dozen different answers. But in venture capital, one thing is clear: we are at the peak of a talent shake-up.\nThe breaking point: 2023-24\nRohit Yadav\n\nLet’s rewind. The bottom of the venture cycle hit in 2023, a year that didn’t just hit valuations and deal flow but also put immense pressure on VC talent.\n\nThe downturn led to frustration, misalignment and career soul-searching. For some, it was a breaking point. For others, a wake-up call.\n\nEither way, it set the stage for one of the most dramatic talent shifts the industry has seen.\n\nWhat fueled this movement? Many factors, among them:\n\n The urge to break free: Many investors are, at their core, entrepreneurs. Some saw 2023 as a catalyst to launch their own firms rather than compete in an overcrowded system.\n Deal flow freeze: A risk-off dealmaking environment left many VCs unable to deploy capital, grow or build their track records, leading to frustration and career stagnation.\n The mega-firm misfit: Large firms often have hierarchies that might stifle rising stars, pushing ambitious partners to carve their paths. Meanwhile, the industry’s shift toward asset management (and away from high-risk, high-reward investing) deepened doubts about staying.\n Burnout and toxicity: Talk of toxic leadership and unhealthy work environments had long existed, but 2023 amplified these frustrations. Some couldn’t ignore internal conflicts and personal challenges anymore.\n Shifting career lanes: Not all VCs fully appreciated their roles. Many started exploring complementary paths, often eyeing operational roles where they could make a more tangible impact.\n Fundraising crunch: Raising capital became an uphill battle as LPs pulled back. With fewer opportunities to grow within, some reconsidered their long-term trajectories.\n AI disruption: The rapid ascent of AI forced firms to reassess their positioning, while some investors jumped ship to chase AI-driven opportunities that their firms weren’t ready — or willing — to embrace.\n The generational shift: For veteran investors, this downturn became a moment of reflection. Some saw it as a natural exit point rather than riding out another decade-plus cycle.\n\nDespite hopes for a rebound, the venture market didn’t reignite in 2024. Recovery was sluggish, and momentum was weak. But one shift was impossible to ignore: VC talent was on the move. What once simmered in the background was now front and center, reshaping the industry in real-time.\nThe talent movement snapshot\n\nCareer moves, like life, aren’t linear. Many of the shifts we saw in the past few quarters might have been brewing for months or even years, and we may never know the real reasons behind every move.\n\nA few notable recent VC moves include Sam Blond of Founder’s Fund, who transitioned from investing to an operational role, while Miles Grimshaw returned to Thrive from Benchmark, and Keith Rabois boomeranged back to Khosla Ventures.\n\nThe urge to build new firms also seemed to accelerate:\n\nMichael Gilroy (ex-Coatue) launched MarathonMP with Gokul Rajaram;\nBilal Zuberi (ex-Lux Capital) started work on a new fund; and\nAnu Hariharan (ex-Y Combinator) forged her path.\n\nOthers had to adapt. Greycroft cut five investors after missing its fundraising goal by 40%, Octopus Ventures laid off 16% of its investment team, and Initialized Capital restructured.\n\nIn Europe, Cavalry Ventures lost its third partner in 2024, while Judith Dada (who left General Catalyst in 2023) moved to Visionaries Club in 2025.\n\nEarly-stage VC also saw notable moves, including Amanda Robson (ex-Cowboy Ventures 1) and Vic Singh (ex-Eniac Ventures) both setting out to start new firms.\nSo, what about 2025?\n\nCareer-defining decisions happen in two key moments: under extreme pressure (like 2023-24) or during peak market euphoria (like 2020-21). Outside these cycles, most stay put. But the last market descent triggered a talent reshuffling that’s still unfolding.\n\nThe best part? There’s still time. This year marks an inflection point. With nine months left, the venture landscape is still in flux but far more optimistic than in 2023-24. This is a rare moment to take control, realign ambitions, reignite networks and embrace reinvention. One thing is clear: The hunger for transformation has never been stronger.\n\nThis year will be defined by bold pivots and quiet recalibrations. Some will take the leap, others will strategically position themselves for moves in the coming quarters and years.\n\nAnd for junior and mid-level VC talent? The opportunity is even bigger. With pressure easing and partner-level transitions reshaping firms, hiring is regaining focus. Now is the time to step up, claim new roles and make bold career moves.\n\nOne thing is undeniable — venture talent is on the move. Are you ready to make yours?\n\nRohit Yadav is the creator of The Big Book of VC, a quarterly insights project known for its “Venture Knowledge Alpha” tagline.

    "content": "Editor’s note: For more Web3 coverage, visit Crunchbase’s Web3 Tracker, where we track startups, investors and funding news in the Web3, cryptocurrency and blockchain space, powered by Crunchbase’s live, comprehensive data.\n\nVenture funding to crypto and blockchain startups more than doubled in the first quarter as crypto enthusiasts seem ready to embrace easing regulations.\n\nHowever, the total dollar figures were heavily skewed by a large $2 billion raise by a crypto exchange with ties to White House.\n\nOverall, venture funding to startups in the crypto and blockchain space — also called Web3 for our purposes here — rocketed to $3.8 billion in 220 deals in Q1, per Crunchbase data. The dollar figure represents a 138% jump from the previous quarter, which saw only $1.6 billion go to Web3 startups in 242 deals.\n\nIt also represents about twice the amount of cash such startups raised in Q1 2024.\nA deeper look\n\nHowever, before any grand announcements of a crypto rebound are made aloud, a deeper look at the numbers shows that that dollar figure was propped up by one big round.\n\nLast month, cryptocurrency exchange Binance received a massive $2 billion investment from Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX. The deal is the single largest investment into a crypto company, beating out FTX’s $1 billion Series B and NYDIG’s $1 billion private equity round in 2021 — both deals raised during the salad days of venture and crypto.\n\nSetting that round aside, Web3 startups raised $1.8 billion last quarter — similar to Q3 and Q4 last year and less than Q2 2024.\n\nDeal flow also continues to shrink, with Q1 seeing fewer than half the number of deals closed during the same quarter a year ago.\n\nThat’s not to say there were not some large deals. San Francisco-based Phantom, a crypto wallet startup, raised a $150 million round led by Paradigm and Sequoia Capital that valued the startup at $3 billion, and Paris-based Flowdesk, a crypto-financial service company building a trading infrastructure, raised a $91.8 million venture round.\nRocky market\n\nThe new White House has energized the Web3 environment — especially in crypto. President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve, and most expect regulation in the crypto industry to ease up substantially under his administration.\n\nHowever, that has not translated into price jumps in the market. Bitcoin was down 9% in Q1, while Ether tumbled 43%.\n\nIronically, the White House may also soon have ties to the newly funded Binance, which pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering laws in 2023. The same day that round was announced it was reported President Trump’s family may take a financial stake in the company, according to The Wall Street Journal. Also that same day, Bloomberg reported that Trump-linked crypto bank World Liberty Financial is in talks with Binance to launch a dollar-pegged stablecoin.\n\nDespite some starts and stops for Web3 in general and crypto in particular, it seems like there is mounting momentum. Some crypto firms even seem to be ready to jump into the tepid IPO waters. Stablecoin issuer Circle filed this week for an offering, and eToro, which operates a trading platform for stocks, cryptocurrencies and other assets, filed for an IPO last month.\n\nInvestors likely will watch those offerings closely as the Web3 sector continues its ups and downs.\nMethodology\n\nFor Web3 funding numbers, we analyze investments made into VC-backed startups in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry group.\nRelated Crunchbase Pro list:\n\nFunding To VC-Backed Web3 Startups\n\nRelated reading:\n\nCrypto Giant Binance Scoops Up $2B From Abu Dhabi’s MGX\nExcitement Builds Around Web3 And Crypto, But VC Dollars Don’t Follow\nWeb3 Funding Gains 43% Year To Year But Dips From Q2\nPublic Raises $135M Series D-2 For AI-Driven Investment\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

    "title": "Cyberattacks by AI agents are coming",
    "content": "Agents are the talk of the AI industry—they’re capable of planning, reasoning, and executing complex tasks like scheduling meetings, ordering groceries, or even taking over your computer to change settings on your behalf. But the same sophisticated abilities that make agents helpful assistants could also make them powerful tools for conducting cyberattacks. They could readily be used to identify vulnerable targets, hijack their systems, and steal valuable data from unsuspecting victims. \n\nAt present, cybercriminals are not deploying AI agents to hack at scale. But researchers have demonstrated that agents are capable of executing complex attacks (Anthropic, for example, observed its Claude LLM successfully replicating an attack designed to steal sensitive information), and cybersecurity experts warn that we should expect to start seeing these types of attacks spilling over into the real world.\n\n“I think ultimately we’re going to live in a world where the majority of cyberattacks are carried out by agents,” says Mark Stockley, a security expert at the cybersecurity company Malwarebytes. “It’s really only a question of how quickly we get there.”\n\nWhile we have a good sense of the kinds of threats AI agents could present to cybersecurity, what’s less clear is how to detect them in the real world. The AI research organization Palisade Research has built a system called LLM Agent Honeypot in the hopes of doing exactly this. It has set up vulnerable servers that masquerade as sites for valuable government and military information to attract and try to catch AI agents attempting to hack in.\n\nThe team behind it hopes that by tracking these attempts in the real world, the project will act as an early warning system and help experts develop effective defenses against AI threat actors by the time they become a serious issue.\n\n“Our intention was to try and ground the theoretical concerns people have,” says Dmitrii Volkov, research lead at Palisade. “We’re looking out for a sharp uptick, and when that happens, we’ll know that the security landscape has changed. In the next few years, I expect to see autonomous hacking agents being told: ‘This is your target. Go and hack it.’”\n\nAI agents represent an attractive prospect to cybercriminals. They’re much cheaper than hiring the services of professional hackers and could orchestrate attacks more quickly and at a far larger scale than humans could. While cybersecurity experts believe that ransomware attacks—the most lucrative kind—are relatively rare because they require considerable human expertise, those attacks could be outsourced to agents in the future, says Stockley. “If you can delegate the work of target selection to an agent, then suddenly you can scale ransomware in a way that just isn’t possible at the moment,” he says. “If I can reproduce it once, then it’s just a matter of money for me to reproduce it 100 times.”\n\nAgents are also significantly smarter than the kinds of bots that are typically used to hack into systems. Bots are simple automated programs that run through scripts, so they struggle to adapt to unexpected scenarios. Agents, on the other hand, are able not only to adapt the way they engage with a hacking target but also to avoid detection—both of which are beyond the capabilities of limited, scripted programs, says Volkov. “They can look at a target and guess the best ways to penetrate it,” he says. “That kind of thing is out of reach of, like, dumb scripted bots.”\n\nSince LLM Agent Honeypot went live in October of last year, it has logged more than 11 million attempts to access it—the vast majority of which were from curious humans and bots. But among these, the researchers have detected eight potential AI agents, two of which they have confirmed are agents that appear to originate from Hong Kong and Singapore, respectively. \n\n“We would guess that these confirmed agents were experiments directly launched by humans with the agenda of something like ‘Go out into the internet and try and hack something interesting for me,’” says Volkov. The team plans to expand its honeypot into social media platforms, websites, and databases to attract and capture a broader range of attackers, including spam bots and phishing agents, to analyze future threats. \n\nTo determine which visitors to the vulnerable servers were LLM-powered agents, the researchers embedded prompt-injection techniques into the honeypot. These attacks are designed to change the behavior of AI agents by issuing them new instructions and asking questions that require humanlike intelligence. This approach wouldn’t work on standard bots.\n\nFor example, one of the injected prompts asked the visitor to return the command “cat8193” to gain access. If the visitor correctly complied with the instruction, the researchers checked how long it took to do so, assuming that LLMs are able to respond in much less time than it takes a human to read the request and type out an answer—typically in under 1.5 seconds. While the two confirmed AI agents passed both tests, the six others only entered the command but didn’t meet the response time that would identify them as AI agents.\n\nExperts are still unsure when agent-orchestrated attacks will become more widespread. Stockley, whose company Malwarebytes named agentic AI as a notable new cybersecurity threat in its 2025 State of Malware report, thinks we could be living in a world of agentic attackers as soon as this year. \n\nAnd although regular agentic AI is still at a very early stage—and criminal or malicious use of agentic AI even more so—it’s even more of a Wild West than the LLM field was two years ago, says Vincenzo Ciancaglini, a senior threat researcher at the security company Trend Micro. \n\n“Palisade Research’s approach is brilliant: basically hacking the AI agents that try to hack you first,” he says. “While in this case we’re witnessing AI agents trying to do reconnaissance, we’re not sure when agents will be able to carry out a full attack chain autonomously. That’s what we’re trying to keep an eye on.” \n\nAnd while it’s possible that malicious agents will be used for intelligence gathering before graduating to simple attacks and eventually complex attacks as the agentic systems themselves become more complex and reliable, it’s equally possible there will be an unexpected overnight explosion in criminal usage, he says: “That’s the weird thing about AI development right now.”\n\nThose trying to defend against agentic cyberattacks should keep in mind that AI is currently more of an accelerant to existing attack techniques than something that fundamentally changes the nature of attacks, says Chris Betz, chief information security officer at Amazon Web Services. “Certain attacks may be simpler to conduct and therefore more numerous; however, the foundation of how to detect and respond to these events remains the same,” he says.\n\nAgents could also be deployed to detect vulnerabilities and protect against intruders, says Edoardo Debenedetti, a PhD student at ETH Zürich in Switzerland, pointing out that if a friendly agent cannot find any vulnerabilities in a system, it’s unlikely that a similarly capable agent used by a malicious party is going to be able to find any either.\n\nWhile we know that AI’s potential to autonomously conduct cyberattacks is a growing risk and that AI agents are already scanning the internet, one useful next step is to evaluate how good agents are at finding and exploiting these real-world vulnerabilities. Daniel Kang, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and his team have built a benchmark to evaluate this; they have found that current AI agents successfully exploited up to 13% of vulnerabilities for which they had no prior knowledge. Providing the agents with a brief description of the vulnerability pushed the success rate up to 25%, demonstrating how AI systems are able to identify and exploit weaknesses even without training. Basic bots would presumably do much worse.\n\nThe benchmark provides a standardized way to assess these risks, and Kang hopes it can guide the development of safer AI systems. “I’m hoping that people start to be more proactive about the potential risks of AI and cybersecurity before it has a ChatGPT moment,” he says. “I’m afraid people won’t realize this until it punches them in the face.”",

    "title": "Trump’s tariffs will deliver a big blow to climate tech",
    "content": "US president Donald Trump’s massive, sweeping tariffs sent global stock markets tumbling on Thursday, setting the stage for a worldwide trade war and ratcheting up the dangers of a punishing recession. \n\nExperts fear that the US cleantech sector is especially vulnerable to a deep downturn, which would undermine the nation’s progress on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and undercut its leadership in an essential, growing industry.\n\n“It would be hard for me to think of cleantech or climate tech sectors that aren’t facing huge risks,” says Noah Kaufman, senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, who served on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Joe Biden. \n\n“I think we’re a country without a federal climate strategy at this point, with an economy headed in the wrong direction, so I don’t see a lot of reason to be optimistic,” he adds.\n\nHow deep and wide-ranging the impact of the coming economic shifts could be depends on many variables still in play and on reactions still to come. In particular, the negotiations underway in Congress over the budget will determine the fate of subsidies for electric vehicles, battery production, and other clean technologies. Many of those programs were established by former president Biden’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBut there are mounting challenges and rising risks across the cleantech and climate tech sectors. Notably any slowdown in the broader economy threatens to tighten corporate and venture capital funding for startups working on carbon removal, synthetic aviation fuels, electric delivery vehicles, and other technologies that help companies meet climate action goals. \n\nIn addition, Trump’s tariffs, particularly the now 54% levy on Chinese goods, will push up the costs of key components for many businesses. Notably, the US imported $4 billion worth of lithium-ion batteries from China during the first four months of last year, so the tariff increase would impose a huge tax on products that go into electric vehicles, laptops, phones, and many other devices. \n\nHigher prices for aluminum, steel, copper, cement, and numerous other goods and materials will also drive up the costs of doing all sorts of business, including building wind turbines, solar farms, and geothermal plants. And if China, Canada, the European Union, and other nations respond with retaliatory trade measures, as is widely expected, it will also become harder or more expensive for US companies to export goods like EVs or battery components to overseas markets. \n\nEven traditional energy stocks took a beating on Wall Street Thursday, out of fear that any broader economic sluggishness will drive down electricity demand.\n\nTrump administration cuts to the Department of Energy and other federal programs could also take away money from demonstration projects that help cleantech companies test and scale up their technologies. And if Congress does eliminate certain subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act, it could halt billion-dollar projects that are being planned or perhaps even some that are already under construction.\n\nThe growing policy uncertainty and weakening economic conditions alone may already be causing some of this to occur.\n\nSince Trump took office, companies have canceled, delayed, or scaled back at least nine US “clean energy supply chain” developments or operations, according to the Big Green Machine, a database maintained by Jay Turner, a professor of environmental studies at Wellesley College, and student researchers there. The projects that have been affected represent some $8 billion in public and private investments, and more than 9,000 jobs.\n\nThey include KORE Power’s planned battery facility in Arizona, which the company halted; Envision Automotive Energy Supply’s paused expansion in Florence County, South Carolina; and Akasol’s closure of two plants in Michigan. \n\nVW also scaled back production at its recently expanded EV factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, amid slower-than-expected growth in sales and, perhaps, the expectation that the Trump administration will strive to roll back consumer tax credits for vehicle purchases.\n\n“The biggest challenge for companies that are making hundred-million- or billion-dollar capital investments is dealing with the uncertainty,” Turner says. “Uncertainty is a real deterrent to making big bets.” \n\nVenture capital investments in clean energy have been cooling for a while. They peaked at $24.5 billion in 2022 and settled at around $18 billion annually during the last two years, according to data provided by Pitchbook. First-quarter figures for this year aren’t yet available, though industry watchers are keen to see where they land. \n\nSome parts of the cleantech sector could hold up better than others through the Trump administration and any upcoming economic gloom. \n\nThe Pitchbook report, for instance, noted that the surge in development of AI data centers is fueling demand for “dispatchable energy sources.” That means the type that can run around the clock, such as nuclear fission, fusion, and geothermal (though in practice, the data center boom has often meant commissioning or relying on natural-gas plants that produce planet-warming emissions).\n\nTrump’s new energy secretary, Chris Wright, previously the chief executive of the oilfield services company Liberty Energy, has also talked favorably about nuclear power and geothermal—and rather unfavorably about renewables like solar and wind. \n\nBut observers fear that more sectors will lose than win in any economic downturn to come, and Turner stresses that the decisions made during this administration could last well beyond it.\n\n“The near-term concern is that this emerging clean-energy industry in the US suffers a significant pullback and the US cedes this market to other countries, especially China, that are actively working to position themselves to be leaders in the clean-energy future,” he says. \n\nThe long-term concern, he adds, is that if government policies on cleantech simply advance and retreat with the whims of each administration, companies will stop trying to make long-term investments that bank on such subsidies, grants or loans. \n\nCatherine Wolfram, a professor of energy and applied economics at MIT, also notes that China and the European Union are forging ahead in developing policies to drive down emissions and build up carbon-free sectors. She observes that they’re both now moving on to the tougher work of cleaning up heavy industries like steel, while the US is “losing ground on even making clean electricity.”\n\n“It’s the worst kind of US exceptionalism,” she says.",

    "content": "Both the largest startup funding round ever and the largest acquisition of a venture-backed company occurred in Q1 2025, reflecting a warming startup environment but also one where capital and opportunities were concentrated among a handful of companies and sectors.\n\nOverall, the quarter marked the strongest one for venture investment since Q2 2022.\n\nBut the quarterly numbers were significantly buoyed by a single round: OpenAI raised the largest private round ever, a $40 billion funding that values the company at $300 billion.\n\nThe deal — which alone accounts for more than half of U.S. venture funding and a third of global funding last quarter — pushed global startup investment in Q1 to $113 billion, Crunchbase data shows. Funding to just the AI sector comprised more than half of last quarter’s global total.\n\nTotal startup funding in Q1 was up 17% quarter over quarter from $96 billion in Q4 2024 and up 54% year over year from $73 billion in Q1 2024.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBillions more in funding\nU.S. gained\nStrongest M&A quarter since 2021\nAI capital concentrated\nLate stage was up\nEarly stage trails\nSeed falls\nCapEx and concentration\nMethodology\nGlossary of funding terms\n\nBillions more in funding\n\nOpenAI moved from the third-most valuable private company to the second-most valuable after SpaceX, which is currently valued at $350 billion. OpenAI has raised a total of $57.6 billion since its founding in 2015. The latest round represents more than two-thirds of the San Francisco-based company’s total funding since it was founded, adding to the $6.6 billion it raised in Q4.\n\nCompetitor Anthropic also raised billions in funding in Q1, but even so, it was a fraction of what OpenAI raised. Anthropic raised $4.5 billion across two funding rounds, after raising $4 billion in Q4.\n\nGenerative AI companies were not the only companies to raise billion-dollar rounds in Q1. U.S.-based immersive reality company Infinite Reality raised $3 billion, and crypto asset company Binance raised $2 billion.\n\nBy comparison, the peak quarter of 2024 was Q4 with $96 billion in total funding. That quarter included a spate of billion-dollar rounds to U.S.-based data and AI companies. Databricks, OpenAI, xAI and Anthropic collectively raised $26.6 billion — a quarter of global funding.\nU.S. gained\n\nVenture funding to U.S. companies totaled $80 billion in Q1 2025, accounting for around 71% of global funding. Funding to Bay Area-based companies alone reached $55 billion, accounting for 69% of U.S. venture capital funding and 49% of global funding.\nStrongest M&A quarter since 2021\n\nQ1 2025 was also the strongest quarter for startup M&A dollar volume since 2021, totaling $71 billion in reported exit value.\n\nWiz’s acquisition by Google, if finalized, will mark the largest acquisition for a private company with a price tag of $32 billion. The deal is still subject to regulatory approval.\n\nIn total, there were 12 acquisitions above $1 billion for venture-backed startups. The most notable include Ampere’s acquisition by SoftBank, Modernizing Medicine’s purchase by Clearlake Capital Group, Moveworks’ acquisition by ServiceNow, and Weights & Biases’ purchase by CoreWeave.\n\nWhile the dollar volume for global M&A was high, deal counts for the quarter came in at more than 500, but remained well below market peak quarters of the around 800 global M&A deals seen in 2021, Crunchbase data shows.\n\nGlobal M&A for venture-backed companies averaged $63 billion each quarter in 2021, with a peak quarter that year at $71 billion, Crunchbase data shows.\nAI capital concentrated\n\nAI was the leading sector for venture funding in the first quarter, with $59.6 billion invested. Last quarter marked the strongest quarter for AI funding ever, with an astonishing 53% of global funding going to the AI sector alone.\n\nThis followed a strong fourth quarter when $44 billion was raised by AI startups globally.\n\nHealthcare and biotech was the second-largest sector for funding in Q1, with $18 billion invested. Financial services companies, the third-largest sector in the quarter, totaled $10.8 billion.\n\nLate stage was up\n\nLate-stage funding in the first quarter gained quarter over quarter. Funding reached $81 billion, up more than 30% quarter over quarter and an increase of 147% year over year from the $33 billion invested in Q1 2024, Crunchbase data shows.\n\nEarly stage trails\n\nEarly-stage funding was slightly down in Q1 reaching $24 billion. Larger Series A and B rounds were led by the healthcare and biotech sector. Large rounds were also found in robotics, AI and cloud services, among other sectors.\n\nSeed falls\n\nSeed funding reached $7.2 billion in Q1, down 14% from $8.4 billion invested a year ago. (Seed funding totals typically increase over time, as many seed rounds are added to the Crunchbase dataset after the close of a quarter.)\n\nCapEx and concentration\n\nThe venture markets are adapting to the massive opportunities that AI unleashes and the imposing costs of its computation. Last quarter tells that story, with more than a third of capital invested in a single company, OpenAI.\n\nValuations are increasing at a faster pace. The Crunchbase Unicorn Board has added around $400 billion in value in the first quarter — from  the 29 companies that joined and from existing unicorns that raised rounds at higher values. The board reached $1 trillion in total funding in January this year and currently tops $5.8 trillion in value.\n\nThe IPO markets for tech companies were slow in Q1. The most high-profile company to go public was New Jersey-based CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure cloud service provider. Its shares priced below their range at $40 per share, but have since seen a significant uptick in price.\n\nWith future large outcomes, M&A has heated up, providing some much-needed liquidity to the venture capital industry.\nMethodology\n\nThe data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of April 2, 2025.\n\nNote that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.\n\nPlease note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.\nGlossary of funding terms\n\nSeed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.\n\nEarly-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types.

    "title": "Tariff-Induced Market Meltdown Worrisome For Startup Valuations And Exits",
    "content": "Unlike public companies, private startup valuations don’t fluctuate massively from day to day based on current events.\n\nEventually, however, private company prices do adjust to reflect trends in the broader markets.\n\nAnd based on what we’re seeing today, things look worrisome.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index was down a staggering 4.8% in midday trading today, following President Trump’s decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imported goods. His order calls for a 10% baseline tariff, along with much higher rates for many countries.\n\nAmong its myriad impacts, the decision is expected to lead to higher consumer prices and depressed demand as manufacturers and retailers pass along tariff costs incurred by their businesses. That was reflected in some of today’s more pronounced drops 1 for tech and consumer bellwethers, including Amazon (down 7%), Apple (down 8%),  Nike (down 10%), and Wayfair (down 25%).\nStartup correction delayed?\n\nNow, over in startupland, we’re not seeing immediate revaluations. For hot startups, repricings might happen once every few months or quarters when there’s a new funding round. And ordinarily, it’s common for companies to go a couple years between revaluations.\n\nThat means the $300 billion post-money valuation announced for OpenAI this week, and the $113 billion valuation set for the newly combined X and xAI aren’t seeing an instant price cut like leading AI chip supplier Nvidia (down 5%).\n\nBut looking ahead, the trajectory appears concerning.\n\nFor one, it’s only a couple years since the last massive startup valuation correction. Scores of companies that enjoyed unicorn status around the market peak in late 2021 later settled for down rounds, folded or filed for bankruptcy.\n\nIn addition, the tech IPO market was sluggish in 2023 and 2024, and only just recently shows signs of warming up. We had a mega-offering last week from CoreWeave, which had a recent market cap around $24 billion. Large offerings from Klarna and Circle are also expected to hit markets in coming weeks.\n\nIn a similar vein, M&A was also on the rise, led by Google’s planned $32 billion purchase of cybersecurity unicorn Wiz, and a bump in billion-dollar-plus acquisitions.\n\nSo, for startup exits, we were finally getting out of a slump, only to face a new obstacle in the form of a tariff-driven market pullback.\nDumb + unpopular = a case for optimism\n\nLooking for a case for optimism in the current scenario, I find myself turning to reality TV. The principle of this media niche has long been that one can succeed with something dumb, so long as it’s popular. However, if a show is both pointlessly stupid and not fun to watch, it will flop.\n\nThe same notion applies to a lot of other areas, including movies, music, romance novels, podcasts, and the list goes on. So why not new tariffs?\n\nAs public markets have demonstrated today, investors find the current tariff moves both dumb and unpopular. Hopefully, those with power to revise foolish decisions will take this as a reason to reverse course. I’m not giving it the highest likelihood, but it’s at least within the realm of possibility.\nRelated reading:\n\nWith Google’s $32B Bid For Wiz, Big Exits Are Finally Picking Up\nA Booming Start To The Year For The Billion-Dollar Exits Board\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman\n\nBased on prices at around noon ET.&#8617;",

    "title": "We should talk more about air-conditioning",
    "content": "Things are starting to warm up here in the New York City area, and it’s got me thinking once again about something that people aren’t talking about enough: energy demand for air conditioners. \n\nI get it: Data centers are the shiny new thing to worry about. And I’m not saying we shouldn’t be thinking about the strain that gigawatt-scale computing installations put on the grid. But a little bit of perspective is important here.\n\nAccording to a report from the International Energy Agency last year, data centers will make up less than 10% of the increase in energy demand between now and 2030, far less than the energy demand from space cooling (mostly air-conditioning).\n\nI just finished up a new story that’s out today about a novel way to make heat exchangers, a crucial component in air conditioners and a whole host of other technologies that cool our buildings, food, and electronics. Let’s dig into why I’m writing about the guts of cooling technologies, and why this sector really needs innovation. \n\nOne twisted thing about cooling and climate change: It’s all a vicious cycle. As temperatures rise, the need for cooling technologies increases. In turn, more fossil-fuel power plants are firing up to meet that demand, turning up the temperature of the planet in the process.\n\n“Cooling degree days” are one measure of the need for additional cooling. Basically, you take a preset baseline temperature and figure out how much the temperature exceeds it. Say the baseline (above which you’d likely need to flip on a cooling device) is 21 °C (70 °F). If the average temperature for a day is 26 °C, that’s five cooling degree days on a single day. Repeat that every day for a month, and you wind up with 150 cooling degree days.\n\nI explain this arguably weird metric because it’s a good measure of total energy demand for cooling—it lumps together both how many hot days there are and just how hot it is. \n\nAnd the number of cooling degree days is steadily ticking up globally. Global cooling degree days were 6% higher in 2024 than in 2023, and 20% higher than the long-term average for the first two decades of the century. Regions that have high cooling demand, like China, India, and the US, were particularly affected, according to the IEA report. You can see a month-by-month breakdown of this data from the IEA here.\n\nThat increase in cooling degree days is leading to more demand for air conditioners, and for energy to power them. Air-conditioning accounted for 7% of the world’s electricity demand in 2022, and it’s only going to get more important from here.\n\nThere were fewer than 2 billion AC units in the world in 2016. By 2050, that could be nearly 6 billion, according to a 2018 report from the IEA. This is a measure of progress and, in a way, something we should be happy about; the number of air conditioners tends to rise with household income. But it does present a challenge to the grid.  \n\nAnother piece of this whole thing: It’s not just about how much total electricity we need to run air conditioners but about when that demand tends to come. As we’ve covered in this newsletter before, your air-conditioning habits aren’t unique. Cooling devices tend to flip on around the same time—when it’s hot. In some parts of the US, for example, air conditioners can represent more than 70% of residential energy demand at times when the grid is most stressed.\n\nThe good news is that we’re seeing innovations in cooling technology. Some companies are building cooling systems that include an energy storage component, so they can charge up when energy is plentiful and demand is low. Then they can start cooling when it’s most needed, without sucking as much energy from the grid during peak hours.\n\nWe’ve also covered alternatives to air conditioners called desiccant cooling systems, which use special moisture-sucking materials to help cool spaces and deal with humidity more efficiently than standard options.\n\nAnd in my latest story, I dug into new developments in heat exchanger technology. Heat exchangers are a crucial component of air conditioners, but you can really find them everywhere—in heat pumps, refrigerators, and, yes, the cooling systems in large buildings and large electronics installations, including data centers.\n\nWe’ve been building heat exchangers basically the same way for nearly a century. These components basically move heat around, and there are a few known ways to do so with devices that are relatively straightforward to manufacture. Now, though, one team of researchers has 3D-printed a heat exchanger that outperforms some standard designs and rivals others. This is still a long way from solving our looming air-conditioning crisis, but the details are fascinating—I hope you’ll give it a read. \n\nWe need more innovation in cooling technology to help meet global demand efficiently so we don’t stay stuck in this cycle. And we’ll need policy and public support to make sure that these technologies make a difference and that everyone has access to them too. \n\nThis article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review’s weekly climate newsletter.

    "title": "Rivals are rising to challenge the dominance of SpaceX",
    "content": "SpaceX is a space launch juggernaut. In just two decades, the company has managed to edge out former aerospace heavyweights Boeing, Lockheed, and Northrop Grumman to gain near-monopoly status over rocket launches in the US; it accounted for 87% of the country’s orbital launches in 2024, according to an analysis by SpaceNews. Since the mid-2010s, the company has dominated NASA’s launch contracts and become a major Pentagon contractor. It is now also the go-to launch provider for commercial customers, having lofted numerous satellites and five private crewed spaceflights, with more to come. \n\nOther space companies have been scrambling to compete for years, but developing a reliable rocket takes slow, steady work and big budgets. Now at least some of them are catching up. \n\nA host of companies have readied rockets that are comparable to SpaceX’s main launch vehicles. The list includes Rocket Lab, which aims to take on SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9 with its Neutron rocket and could have its first launch in late 2025, and Blue Origin, owned by Jeff Bezos, which recently completed the first mission of a rocket it hopes will compete against SpaceX’s Starship. \n\nSome of these competitors are just starting to get rockets off the ground. And the companies could also face unusual headwinds, given that SpaceX’s Elon Musk has an especially close relationship with the Trump administration and has allies at federal regulatory agencies, including those that provide oversight of the industry.\n\nBut if all goes well, the SpaceX challengers can help improve access to space and prevent bottlenecks if one company experiences a setback. “More players in the market is good for competition,” says Chris Combs, an aerospace engineer at the University of Texas at San Antonio. “I think for the foreseeable future it will still be hard to compete with SpaceX on price.” But, he says, the competitors could push SpaceX itself to become better and provide those seeking access to space with a wider array of options..\n\nA big lift\n\nThere are a few reasons why SpaceX was able to cement its position in the space industry. When it began in the 2000s, it had three consecutive rocket failures and seemed poised to fold. But it barreled through with Musk’s financial support, and later with a series of NASA and defense contracts. It has been a primary beneficiary of NASA’s commercial space program, developed in the 2010s with the intention of propping up the industry. \n\n“They got government contracts from the very beginning,” says Victoria Samson, a space policy expert at the Secure World Foundation in Broomfield, Colorado. “I wouldn’t say it’s a handout, but SpaceX would not exist without a huge influx of repeated government contracts. To this day, they’re still dependent on government customers, though they have commercial customers too.”\n\nSpaceX has also effectively achieved a high degree of vertical integration, Samson points out: It owns almost all parts of its supply chain, designing, building, and testing all its major hardware components in-house, with a minimal use of suppliers. That gives it not just control over its hardware but considerably lower costs, and the price tag is the top consideration for launch contracts. \n\nThe company was also open to taking risks other industry stalwarts were not. “I think for a very long time the industry looked at spaceflight as something that had to be very precise and perfect, and not a lot of room for tinkering,” says Combs. “SpaceX really was willing to take some risks and accept failure in ways that others haven’t been. That’s easier to do when you’re backed by a billionaire.” \n\nWhat’s finally enabled international and US-based competitors to emerge has been a growing customer base looking for launch services, along with some investors’ deep pockets. \n\nSome of these companies are taking aim at SpaceX’s Falcon 9, which can lift as much as about 20,000 kilograms into orbit and is used for sending multiple satellites or the crewed Dragon into space. “There is a practical monopoly in the medium-lift launch market right now, with really only one operational vehicle,” says Murielle Baker, a spokesperson for Rocket Lab, a US-New Zealand company.\n\nRocket Lab plans to take on the Falcon 9 with its Neutron rocket, which is expected to have its inaugural flight later this year from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. The effort is building on the success of the company’s smaller Electron rocket, and Neutron’s first stage is intended to be reusable after it parachutes down to the ocean. \n\nAnother challenger is Texas-based Firefly, whose Alpha rocket can be launched from multiple spaceports so that it can reach different orbits. Firefly has already secured NASA and Space Force contracts, with more launches coming this year (and on March 2 it also became the second private company to successfully land a spacecraft on the moon). Next year, Relativity Space aims to loft its first Terran R rocket, which is partially built from 3D-printed components. And the Bill Gates–backed Stoke Space aims to launch its reusable Nova rocket in late 2025 or, more likely, next year.\n\nCompetitors are also rising for SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, holding out the prospect of more options for sending massive payloads to higher orbits and deep space. Furthest along is the Vulcan Centaur rocket, a creation of United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. It’s expected to have its third and fourth launches in the coming months, delivering Space Force satellites to orbit. Powered by engines from Blue Origin, the Vulcan Centaur is slightly wider and shorter than the Falcon rockets. It currently isn’t reusable, but it’s less expensive than its predecessors, ULA’s Atlas V and Delta IV, which are being phased out. \n\nMark Peller, the company’s senior vice president on Vulcan development and advanced programs, says the new rocket comes with multiple advantages. “One is overall value, in terms of dollars per pound to orbit and what we can provide to our customers,” he says, “and the second is versatility: Vulcan was designed to go to a range of orbits.” He says more than 80 missions are already lined up. \n\nVulcan’s fifth flight, slated for no earlier than May, will launch the long-awaited Sierra Space Dream Chaser, a spaceplane that can carry cargo (and possibly crew) to the International Space Station. ULA also has upcoming Vulcan launches planned for Amazon’s Kuiper satellite constellation, a potential Starlink rival.\n\nMeanwhile, though it took a few years, Blue Origin now has a truly orbital heavy-lift spacecraft: In January, it celebrated the inaugural launch of its towering New Glenn, a rocket that’s only a bit shorter than NASA’s Space Launch System and SpaceX’s Starship. Future flights could launch national security payloads. \n\nCompetition is emerging abroad as well. After repeated delays, Europe’s heavy-lift Ariane 6, from Airbus subsidiary Arianespace, had its inaugural flight last year, ending the European Space Agency’s temporary dependence on SpaceX. A range of other companies are trying to expand European launch capacity, with assistance from ESA.\n\nChina is moving quickly on its own launch organizations too. “They had no less than seven ‘commercial’ space launch companies that were all racing to develop an effective system that could deliver a payload into orbit,” Kari Bingen, director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says of China’s efforts. “They are moving fast and they have capital behind them, and they will absolutely be a competitor on the global market once they’re successful and probably undercut what US and European launch companies are doing.” The up-and-coming Chinese launchers include Space Pioneer’s reusable Tianlong-3 rocket and Cosmoleap’s Yueqian rocket. The latter is to feature a “chopstick clamp” recovery of the first stage, where it’s grabbed by the launch tower’s mechanical arms, similar to the concept SpaceX is testing for its Starship.\n\nGlitches and government\n\nBefore SpaceX’s rivals can really compete, they need to work out the kinks, demonstrate the reliability of their new spacecraft, and show that they can deliver low-cost launch services to customers. \n\nThe process is not without its challenges. Boeing’s Starliner delivered astronauts to the ISS on its first crewed flight in June 2024, but after thruster malfunctions, they were left stranded at the orbital outpost for nine months. While New Glenn reached orbit as planned, its first stage didn’t land successfully and its upper stage was left in orbit. \n\nSpaceX itself has had some recent struggles. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded the Falcon 9 more than once following malfunctions in the second half of 2024. The company still shattered records last year, though, with more than 130 Falcon 9 launches. It has continued with that record pace this year, despite additional Falcon 9 delays and more glitches with its booster and upper stage. SpaceX also conducted its eighth Starship test flight in March, just two months after the previous one, but both failed minutes after liftoff, raining debris down from the sky.\n\nAny company must deal with financial challenges as well as engineering ones. Boeing is reportedly considering selling parts of its space business, following Starliner’s malfunctions and problems with its 737 Max aircraft. And Virgin Orbit, the launch company that spun off from Virgin Galactic, shuttered in 2023.\n\nAnother issue facing would-be commercial competitors to SpaceX in the US is the complex and uncertain political environment. Musk does not manage day-to-day operations of the company. But he has close involvement with DOGE, a Trump administration initiative that has been exerting influence on the workforces and budgets of NASA, the Defense Department, and regulators relevant to the space industry. \n\nJared Isaacman, a billionaire who bankrolled the groundbreaking 2021 commercial mission Inspiration4, returned to orbit, again via a SpaceX craft, on Polaris Dawn last September. Now he may become Trump’s NASA chief, a position that could give him the power to nudge NASA toward awarding new lucrative contracts to SpaceX. In February it was reported that SpaceX’s Starlink might land a multibillion-dollar FAA contract previously awarded to Verizon. \n\nIt is also possible that SpaceX could strengthen its position with respect to the regulatory scrutiny it has faced for environmental and safety issues at its production and launch sites on the coasts of Texas and Florida, as well as scrutiny of its rocket crashes and the resulting space debris. Oversight from the FAA, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Environmental Protection Agency may be weak. Conflicts of interest have already emerged at the FAA, and the Trump administration has also attempted to incapacitate the National Labor Relations Board. SpaceX had previously tried to block the board from acting after nine workers accused the company of unfair labor practices.\n\nSpaceX did not respond to MIT Technology Review’s requests for comment for this story.\n\n“I think there’s going to be a lot of emphasis to relieve a lot of the regulations, in terms of environmental impact studies, and things like that,” Samson says. “I thought there’d be a separation between [Musk’s] interests, but now, it’s hard to say where he stops and the US government begins.”\n\nRegardless of the politics, the commercial competition will surely heat up throughout 2025. But SpaceX has a considerable head start, Bingen argues: “It’s going to take a lot for these companies to effectively compete and potentially dislodge SpaceX, given the dominant position that [it has] had.”\n\nRamin Skibba is an astrophysicist turned science writer and freelance journalist, based in the Bay Are",

    "title": "The machines are rising — but developers still hold the keys",
    "content": "Rumors of the ongoing death of software development — that it’s being slain by AI — are greatly exaggerated. In reality, software development is at a fork in the road: embracing the (currently) far-off notion of fully automated software development or acknowledging the work of a software developer is much more than just writing lines of code.\n\nThe decision the industry makes could have significant long-term consequences. Increasing complacency around AI-generated code and a shift to what has been termed “vibe coding” — where code is generated through natural language prompts until the results seem to work — will lead to code that’s more error-strewn, more expensive to run and harder to change in the future. And, if the devaluation of software development skills continues, we may even lack a workforce with the skills and knowledge to fix things down the line. \n\nThis means software developers are going to become more important to how the world builds and maintains software. Yes, there are many ways their practices will evolve thanks to AI coding assistance, but in a world of proliferating machine-generated code, developer judgment and experience will be vital.\n\nThe dangers of AI-generated code are already here\n\nThe risks of AI-generated code aren’t science fiction: they’re with us today. Research done by GitClear earlier this year indicates that with AI coding assistants (like GitHub Copilot) going mainstream, code churn — which GitClear defines as “changes that were either incomplete or erroneous when the author initially wrote, committed, and pushed them to the company’s git repo&#8221; — has significantly increased. GitClear also found there was a marked decrease in the number of lines of code that have been moved, a signal for refactored code (essentially the care and feeding to make it more effective).\n\nIn other words, from the time coding assistants were introduced there’s been a pronounced increase in lines of code without a commensurate increase in lines deleted, updated, or replaced. Simultaneously, there&#8217;s been a decrease in lines moved — indicating a lot of code has been written but not refactored. More code isn’t necessarily a good thing (sometimes quite the opposite); GitClear’s findings ultimately point to complacency and a lack of rigor about code quality.\n\nCan AI be removed from software development?\n\nHowever, AI doesn’t have to be removed from software development and delivery. On the contrary, there’s plenty to be excited about. As noted in the latest volume of the Technology Radar — Thoughtworks’ report on technologies and practices from work with hundreds of clients all over the world — the coding assistance space is full of opportunities. \n\nSpecifically, the report noted tools like Cursor, Cline and Windsurf can enable software engineering agents. What this looks like in practice is an agent-like feature inside developer environments that developers can ask specific sets of coding tasks to be performed in the form of a natural language prompt. This enables the human/machine partnership.\n\nThat being said, to only focus on code generation is to miss the variety of ways AI can help software developers. For example, Thoughtworks has been interested in how generative AI can be used to understand legacy codebases, and we see a lot of promise in tools like Unblocked, which is an AI team assistant that helps teams do just that. In fact, Anthropic’s Claude Code helped us add support for new languages in an internal tool, CodeConcise. We use CodeConcise to understand legacy systems; and while our success was mixed, we do think there’s real promise here.\n\nTightening practices to better leverage AI\n\nIt’s important to remember much of the work developers do isn’t developing something new from scratch. A large proportion of their work is evolving and adapting existing (and sometimes legacy) software. Sprawling and janky code bases that have taken on technical debt are, unfortunately, the norm. Simply applying AI will likely make things worse, not better, especially with approaches like vibe. \n\nThis is why developer judgment will become more critical than ever. In the latest edition of the Technology Radar report, AI-friendly code design is highlighted, based on our experience that AI coding assistants perform best with well-structured codebases. \n\nIn practice, this requires many different things, including clear and expressive naming to ensure context is clearly communicated (essential for code maintenance), reducing duplicate code, and ensuring modularity and effective abstractions. Done together, these will all help make code more legible to AI systems.\n\nGood coding practices are all too easy to overlook when productivity and effectiveness are measured purely in terms of output, and even though this was true before there was AI tooling, software development needs to focus on good coding first.\n\nAI assistance demands greater human responsibility\n\nInstagram co-founder Mike Krieger recently claimed that in three years software engineers won’t write any code: they will only review AI-created code. This might sound like a huge claim, but it’s important to remember that reviewing code has always been a major part of software development work. With this in mind, perhaps the evolution of software development won’t be as dramatic as some fear.\n\nBut there’s another argument: as AI becomes embedded in how we build software, software developers will take on more responsibility, not less. This is something we’ve discussed a lot at Thoughtworks: the job of verifying that an AI-built system is correct will fall to humans. Yes, verification itself might be AI-assisted, but it will be the role of the software developer to ensure confidence. \n\nIn a world where trust is becoming highly valuable — as evidenced by the emergence of the chief trust officer — the work of software developers is even more critical to the infrastructure of global industry. It’s vital software development is valued: the impact of thoughtless automation and pure vibes could prove incredibly problematic (and costly) in the years to come.\n\nThis content was produced by Thoughtworks.

    "content": "A new 3D-printed design could make an integral part of cooling systems like air conditioners or refrigerators smaller and more efficient, according to new research. \n\nHeat exchangers are devices that whisk away heat, and they’re everywhere—used in data centers, ships, factories, and buildings. The aim is to pass as much heat as possible from one side of the device to the other. Most use one of a few standard designs that have historically been easiest and cheapest to make. \n\n“Heat exchangers are at the center of the industrial economy. They’re an essential part of every machine and every system that moves energy,” says William King, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and one of the authors of the new study. Existing designs tend to favor straight lines, right angles, and round tubes, he adds. \n\nKing and his colleagues used 3D printing to design a heat exchanger that includes features to optimize heat movement, like wavy walls and pyramid-shaped bumps, which wouldn’t be possible to make using traditional manufacturing techniques. \n\nThe team had set out to design a system based on a common refrigerant called R-134a, which is commonly used in devices like air conditioners and refrigerators. When cold water lowers the temperature of the refrigerant, it changes from a gas to a liquid on its path through the device. That liquid refrigerant can then go on to other parts of the cooling system, where it’s used to lower the temperature of anything from a room to a rack of servers. \n\nThe best way to cool the refrigerant tends to involve building very thin walls between the two sides of the device and maximizing the amount of contact that the water and the refrigerant make with those walls. (Think about how much colder you’d get wearing a thin T-shirt and pants and lying down on ice than simply touching it with your gloved hands.)\n\nTo design the best possible heat exchanger, researchers used simulations and developed machine-learning models to help predict the performance of different designs under different conditions. After 36,000 simulations, the researchers landed on the one they decided to develop.\n\nAmong the key components: small fins that jut out on the side of the device that touches the water, increasing the surface area to maximize heat transfer. The team also designed wavy passageways for the water to pass through—once again helping to maximize surface area. Simulations helped the researchers figure out exactly how curvy the passages should be and where precisely to place the fins.\n\nOn the side of the devices where the refrigerant passes through, the design includes small pyramid-shaped bumps along the walls. These not only maximize the area for cooling but also help mix the refrigerant as it passes through and prevent liquid from coating the wall (which would slow down the heat transfer).\n\nAfter settling on a design, the researchers used a 3D-printing technique called direct metal laser sintering, in which lasers melt and fuse together a metal powder (in this case, an aluminum alloy), layer by layer.\n\nIn testing, the researchers found that the heat exchanger created with this technique was able to cool down the refrigerant more efficiently than other designs. The new device was able to achieve a power density of over six megawatts per meter cubed—outperforming one common traditional design, the shell-tube configuration, by between 30% and 50% with the same pumping power. The device’s power density was similar to that of brazed plate heat exchangers, another common design in industry. \n\nOverall, this device doesn’t dramatically outperform the state-of-the-art technology, but the technique of using modeling and 3D printing to produce new heat exchanger designs is promising, says Dennis Nasuta, director of research and development at Optimized Thermal Systems, a consulting firm that works with companies in the HVAC industry on design and research. “It’s worth exploring, and I don’t think that we know yet where we can push it,” Nasuta says.\n\nOne challenge is that today, additive manufacturing techniques such as laser sintering are slow and expensive compared with traditional manufacturing; they wouldn’t be economical or feasible to rely on for all our consumer cooling devices, he says. For now, this type of approach could be most useful in niche applications like aerospace and high-end automotives, which could more likely bear the cost, he adds. \n\nThis particular study was funded by the US Office of Naval Research. Next-generation ships have more electronics aboard than ever, and there’s a growing need for compact and efficient systems to deal with all that extra heat, says Nenad Miljkovic, one of the authors of the study. \n\nEnergy demand for cooling buildings alone is set to double between now and 2050, and new designs could help efficiently meet the massive demand forecast for the coming decades. But challenges including manufacturing costs would need to be overcome to help innovations like the one designed by King and his team make a dent in real devices.\n\nAnother barrier to adopting these new techniques, Nasuta says, is that current standards don’t demand more efficiency. Other technologies already exist that could help make our devices more efficient, but they’re not used for the same reason. \n\nIt will take time for new manufacturing techniques, including 3D printing, to trickle into our devices, Natsua adds: “This isn’t going to be in your AC next year.”",

The software will also be sector-specific when it&#8217;s released more widely in the first quarter of next year. \n\nThe company first came together this past summer led by Petraeus, who joined the U.S. Reserve Officers&#8217; Training Corps to help defray the cost of her Ivy League education and wound up spending seven years in the U.S. Army, including as a civil affairs officer, before co-founding an online meals marketplace, then spending a year with McKinsey & Co. to get a better handle on how businesses are run. \n\nPetraeus says that across her experience, and particularly in the Army, she had &#8220;great leaders&#8221; who were &#8220;thoughtful about their [reports&#8217;] development goals and what was happening in their personal lives, and brought out the best in their people, rather than making them feel less than or marginalized.&#8221; \n\nStill, she was aware that from an institutional standpoint, most harassment training is not thoughtful, that it&#8217;s a matter of checking boxes on an annual basis to ensure compliance with different state laws, depending on where an organization is headquartered. She marveled that so much of the content employees are consuming seems &#8220;designed for a 1980s law firm.&#8221; \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nCasstime, a four-year-old, Shenzhen, China-based auto aftermarket procurement platform, has raised $80 million in Series C-1 funding co-led by Sequoia Capital China and Source Code Capital, with participation from earlier backer Hua Partners.

But I also knew from our own experience in struggling to raise money the need for more capital in Utah, and I thought having that operator-entrepreneur perspective could be useful.” \n\nA first fund, like many in the industry, was more of an experiment, though it was a decent $23 million, thanks largely to the support of Chegg CEO Dan Rosensweig, who was early to commit capital to the fund. A second ($56 million) fund followed when Krommenhoek and John Mayfield — a friend who joined him from a marketing role at Qualtrics — began investing more seriously in their backyard and beyond. \n\nThey were soon joined by a third investor, Diogo Myrrha, who began as a principal with the firm and is now a general partner.

Then he really began to bounce around. Park worked as a trader in New York out of college, embraced the ski-bum life in Utah, then headed to Asia for Uber, where he spent six years, running its expansion team, then managing its entire Southeast Asia business out of Singapore. \n\nMore specifically, he was responsible for eight countries across the region, and 350 people, which didn’t give him a lot of time to organize his home. But he wasn’t overwhelmed by the chaos. Instead, he says that in Singapore, something unusual happened. “There’s this huge culture of landlords furnishing space to attract expats,” explains Park. “The furnishings aren’t super high-end, but they’re well-designed and well put together, and it enabled me to be basically moved in as soon as I put my clothes in the closet.” Suddenly, coming home was a treat — a new sensation for him. “For the first time, I was proud to host friends for dinners and barbecues and to just open the door and relax.” \n\nPark knew his U.S. friends could benefit from the same experience, and before long, he was talking with his Dartmouth classmate turned product and industrial designer Christian Talmage about forming their own company. Enter Oliver Space, which provides a lot of what that Singaporean landlord delivered to Park. It furnishes places for busy professionals, making moving into a new home as easy as hanging up their clothes. \n\nThe now year-old service is available in the Bay Area only. And Oliver Space employs just a dozen people so far. But the company has already gained enough traction to attract $6.8 million in seed funding from an interesting array of investors, including Mayfield, Abstract Ventures, investors Jana Messerschmidt and April Underwood, Opendoor founder Eric Wu, and Kevin and Julia Hartz of Eventbrite, among others. \n\nNow, Oliver Space just has to grow as quickly, or more so, than other furniture-as-service startups to recently attract funding. \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nGreensill, an eight-year-old, London-based provider of working capital and supply chain finance, has raised $655 million in new funding from earlier backer SoftBank Vision Fund.

In a statement announcing the award, the Defense Department said: “The acquisition process was conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.” All parties “were treated fairly and evaluated consistently with the solicitation’s stated evaluation criteria,” said the statement. “We’re surprised about this conclusion,” Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said in a separate statement. “AWS is the clear leader in cloud computing, and a detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings clearly lead to a different conclusion.” The Washington Post has more here.\n\nSponsored By . . .\n\nGot funding?

Let&#8217;s talk.\n\nVC Ben Horowitz on WeWork, Uber and One Cultural Value His Employees Can&#8217;t Break\n\nBen Horowitz, the co-founder of the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, has a new book coming out this coming Monday titled “What You Do is Who You Are,” that takes a look at how to create “culture” at a company. \n\nIt’s a word that’s thrown around a lot but that&#8217;s very hard to grasp, let alone implement in a sustainable way. Horowitz learned firsthand as a CEO how elusive it can be when he took stock of his company, only to discover it was made up of “screamers who intimidated their people,” others who “neglected to give any feedback,” and at least one compulsive liar who excelled at sucking up to Horowitz and also making up stories from whole cloth. \n\nHorowitz says creating culture was a missing part of his education, and in this new book — a follow-up to his best-selling “The Hard Thing About Hard Things” — he does his best to fill that gap for other CEOs, using his own experience, as well as lessons gleaned from historical figures Toussaint Louverture and Genghis Khan, along with Shaka Senghor, a contemporary who served time for murder and today is a criminal justice reform advocate. \n\nIt’s an instructive and novel combination, and we suggest picking up the book, especially if you love history. In the meantime, we sat down recently with Horowitz to talk about its timing and whether some of the biggest cultural blow-ups in the startup industry — Uber and WeWork — could have been avoided. These excerpts have been edited for length and clarity. Note that we’ll have more of the conversation — including Horowitz’s thoughts about dual-class shares — for readers of Extra Crunch on Monday. \n\nYou’ve just written a book about culture that’s coming out just as a lot of questions are being raised about culture because of WeWork. What happened there? \n\n[Cofounder Adam Neumann] had a certain kind of culture there. He had some holes — some great strengths and great holes. And sometimes that happens. When you’re really good at part of it, you can delude yourself into thinking that you’ve got everything you need when you have some massive incompleteness. \n\nAdam is so amazing. Like, the way they got all the money and everything. And the vision was so spectacular. And everybody there believed it, and they recruited some phenomenal talent. But when you’re that optimistic, it does help to have something in the culture that says [allows] people to bring you the bad news, like, if the accounting is all over the place or what have you. \n\nAs with Uber’s Travis Kalanick, whose culture also came under fire, Neumann operated in very plain sight. He wasn’t hiding who he was or what he was spending. \n\nRight, everybody knew how Travis was running the company. Everyone in Silicon Valley knew, let alone everyone on the board. The culture was published. You can look up Uber’s values [from that period]. \n\nTravis designed, I think, a really compelling culture, and believed in it, and published it. And the consequences of what he was missing were also super well-known. It’s only when board members think people are coming after them that [they take an interest in these things]. \n\nWhat are the biggest lessons in these two cases? \n\nI obviously know more about Uber [as a Lyft investor who follows the space]. In Uber’s case, it’s a very subtle thing. Travis had a really good code. But he had a bug in it. \n\nI think it was reported that, like, Travis encouraged bad behavior. I don’t think he did at all. I just think he didn’t make it clear that legal and ethical [considerations] were more important than competitiveness. As a result, when left to their own devices, in a distributed organization where there was a lot of distributed power, that combination had people doing things that were out of bounds. \n\nAnd he was making everybody so much money. And the company was growing so fast that, for the board members, I suspect they were like, ‘As long as it’s making money, I’m not going to worry about what happens next.’ \n\nTo me, the unfair part is, like, they shouldn’t get any credit at the end. Whatever you’re blaming Travis for [you should blame them, too] because they didn’t see it, either. I think that’s a charitable way of putting it. \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nFountain Medical, a 12-year-old, Beijing, China-based contract research organization for pharma, has raised $62 million in Series D funding led by Goldman Sachs, with participation from Lilly Asia Ventures.

There’s no more days needed to go fundraising. There’s no more days needed to go prove to the investor community that we’re a viable company. The size of the commitment that SoftBank has made to this company in the past and now is $18.5 billion. To put the things in context, that is bigger than the GDP of my country where I came from. That’s a country where there’s 11 million people.” \n\nClaure, a native of Bolivia who was named chairman as part of SoftBank’s rescue of the beleaguered co-working company, has been a SoftBank lieutenant for the last five years, and currently holds a variety of titles on its behalf, including COO of SoftBank Group Corp, CEO of SoftBank Group International and CEO of SoftBank Latin America. \n\nHe has said he first met SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son after building up his own business, Brightstar — a cellphone reseller — then selling 57% of it to SoftBank in 2013 in a deal that valued the company at $2.2 billion.

Headquartered in Austin with senior-level talent in San Francisco, we are a PR agency with expertise in funding launches. Our VC Portfolio Funding Launch Accelerator Program is a 5-week sprint that ensures your funding news gets the business & tech press coverage it deserves. Beyond funding, we collaborate with both startups and enterprises to meet your business goals (with 15 exits under our belt). Interested? Let&#8217;s talk.\n\nHave We Reached the Tipping Point?\n\nLimited partners or LPs &#8212; the pension funds, the university endowments, the family offices that largely provide venture firms with their spending money &#8212; are receiving a lot of attention from venture capitalists, some of it unwanted. VCs have begun knocking down their doors with requests for fresh capital commitments so they&#8217;ll have money to invest if the market cools down. \n\nThe problem is, many of these LPs are already over-allocated. LPs traditionally invest in many asset classes, such as public equities, and they allocate a small percentage of their portfolio to venture capital. Suddenly, they&#8217;re finding they&#8217;ve forked over more than they&#8217;d intended to VCs. \n\nThere are several reasons for this situation. First, VCs are returning to them ever faster for more capital &#8212; sometimes in less than two years&#8217; time &#8212; because they are in vesting at such a furious pace. \n\nCompounding the problem, not all LPs have received returns from their VC investments that they can recycle into new venture capital allocations. In some cases, this capital is still tied up in startups that are raising much more money than in the past and staying private longer. &#8220;We have some large exposures to blue chip names where IPOs have been rumored to be coming for a long time already, and now it&#8217;s maybe 2021, maybe 2022,&#8221; says one manager who asked not to be named. In other cases where startups have gone public, falling prices have prompted VCs to hang on to their shares instead of distribute them. \n\nThe result is that LPs are having to cut back on the number of managers they can fund, and that could mean bad news for venture capitalists and startups alike. These LPs don&#8217;t have much choice. As the LP explains it, &#8220;We have a pretty structured allocation process, and we&#8217;re really trying to be creative,&#8221; she says. One venture manager who reappeared too quickly for more money was &#8220;easy to walk away from,&#8221; says this person. &#8220;Others, we&#8217;re having to do financial backflips for them to remain strong partners.&#8221; Either way, this LP adds, &#8220;We can&#8217;t add any new relationships right now,&#8221; meaning new venture teams in particular are out of luck. &#8220;When [VCs] shorten their fundraising cycle by nine months to a year, you can only squeeze the balloon so much.&#8221; \n\nSoftBank&#8217;s $100 billion &#8220;Vision Fund&#8221; is one big reason LPs find themselves in their current predicament. From the moment SoftBank began waving money around several years ago, it launched a vicious cycle. According to Chris Douvos, whose investment firm, Ahoy Capital, owns stakes in such venture funds as True Ventures and First Round Capital, &#8220;When Andreessen Horowitz hit the scene a decade ago, they changed the tempo of investing and everyone got more aggressive in their dealmaking as a response. Then SoftBank entered the picture in a big way, and it was like a16z on steroids.&#8221; \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nBlueground, a six-year-old, New York-based startup providing turnkey flexible rental apartments, has raised $50 million in Series B funding, roughly six months after raising $20 million in Series A funding.

We&#8217;re also headed to Berlin soon, including to interview Klarna&#8217;s Sebastian Siemiatkowski, who we last sat down with at a tiny coffee shop in San Francisco (before his company became Europe&#8217;s most highly valued private company). Hope to see some of you there, too.\n\nTop News \n\nMark Hurd, who until last month was one of two CEOs leading the database software giant Oracle, passed away this morning at age 62, one month after telling employees in a letter that he was taking a leave of absence owing to health reasons. TechCrunch has more here. \n\nSoftBank Group is assembling a rescue financing plan for WeWork that may value the office-sharing company below $8 billion, according to Bloomberg. The new figure is a fraction of the $47 billion valuation the startup commanded as recently as January, and yet it *still* seems a little high when compared with its bigger, profitable, publicly traded rival IWG, whose valuation is roughy half that amount.\n\nSponsored By &#8230;\n\nFun fact: Amazon went public in 1997 with $16 million in revenue and a market cap of $438 million. #ThoseWereTheDays. Unless you can write a $1 million check, it’s almost impossible to get exposure to early stage tech. Enter EquityZen. EquityZen allows accredited investors to access proven pre-IPO tech firms like Impossible Foods, SpaceX, Stripe, Rivian Automotive and Epic Games through its pooled funds. Explore EquityZen’s secondary market today.\n\nAdam Neumann Planned for His Children and Grandchildren to Control WeWork \n\nWeWork co-founder Adam Neumann didn’t plan for his family’s control of WeWork to end at his death but instead expected to pass that control to future generations of Neumanns, too, says Business Insider. \n\nThe outlet reports that in a speech Neumann gave to employees in January of this year, footage of which it says it has viewed, Neumann is seen saying that WeWork isn’t “just controlled — we’re generationally controlled.” He reportedly goes on to say that while the five children he shares with wife Rebekah Neumann “don’t have to run the company,” they “do have to stay the moral compass of the company.” \n\nAccording to BI, Neumann even invoked his future grandchildren, telling those gathered: “It’s important that one day, maybe in 100 years, maybe in 300 years, a great-great-granddaughter of mine will walk into that room and say, ‘Hey, you don’t know me; I actually control the place. The way you’re acting is not how we built it,’” he said. \n\nThese may sound like more outlandish proclamations from Neumann, who has a flair for the dramatic. (Talking to Fast Company earlier this year, he compared WeWork to a rare jewel, asking, “Do you know how long it takes a diamond to be created?”) \n\nBut before WeWork began coming apart at the seams, Neumann had every reason to believe that he could pass power down to his heirs. \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings  \n\nArsenalBio, a year-old, South San Francisco-based biotech outfit that hopes to improve the ability of T cell therapies to better fight a broader range of cancers, has raised $85 million in Series A funding. Investors include Westlake Village BioPartners, the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, Kleiner Perkins, the University of California, San Francisco Foundation Investment Company, Euclidean Capital and Osage Venture Partners. TechCrunch has much more here. \n\nBig-But-Not-Crazy-Big Fundings  \n\nMadbox, a 4.5-year-old, France-based mobile games studio, has raised $16.5 million in Series A funding from Alven. TechCrunch has more here.\n\nSmaller Fundings  \n\nTenfold, a four-year-old, Austin, Tex.-based maker of customer service software, has raised $7.5 million in Series C funding led by Next Coast Ventures, with participation from earlier backers Andreessen Horowitz, Geekdom Fund, and Salesforce Ventures. Pulse 2.0 has more here.\n\nNew Funds \n\nBloomberg Beta, the six-year-old, San Francisco-based outfit that uses Bloomberg LP’s money to make bets on startups, has closed its third fund with $75 million, according to Roy Bahat, who’d previously run the online media company IGN and who operates the fund as an equal partnership with Karin Klein and James Chan. (Klein formerly ran Bloomberg’s new initiatives; Chan was formerly a principal with Trinity Ventures.) We talked with Bahat briefly last night about the new vehicle to ask how its capital will be deployed.\n\nExits \n\nThe Kik messaging platform has been bought by MediaLab, a holding company which operates Whisper and a number of other apps, the company announced earlier today. CoinDesk has more here.\n\nPeople \n\nDi-Ann Eisnor, a WeWork exec, has left the company, says The Information. Eisnor reported to Adam Neumann and had &#8220;hired a group of designers, researchers and engineers focused on urban problems such as housing affordability and constructing buildings with sustainable material,&#8221; says the outlet, adding that her team of about 30 employees have left the company or are planning to depart.  \n\nBill Gates on why he thinks we can predict the future. \n\nIlana Stern has joined Peterson Ventures as general partner. She was previously CEO of the made-to-order dress store Weddington Way. More here.\n\nSponsored By &#8230;\n\nFintech Harness Wealth has built a process to help clients, on average, identify $100K+ in potential untapped financial value over time.

    "title": "Twitter User Claims TradingView Has Ignored a Fibonacci Retracement Bug for 5 Years",
    "content": "Update: the CTO of TradingView told Cointelegraph in comments that the reports of a bug were inaccurate, and the Twitter user partially withdrew his earlier claims that the tool was broken. Popular chart analysis service TradingView reportedly contains a bug in the Fibonacci retracement technical analysis tool, according to a tweet by self-proclaimed certified Elliott wave analyst Cryptoteddybear published on June 13. The Elliott wave principle is a type of technical analysis for predicting prices in financial markets by looking at recurring patterns. In a video that he uploaded to YouTube, the analyst explains that the tool does linear calculations when in logarithmic charts, which he notes is a significant issue for Elliot wave traders. The official Twitter account of the company behind the charting service answered his tweet, announcing that the issue is being investigated, to which Cryptoteddybear answered: &ldquo;Thank you @tradingview for finally taking this issue seriously.&rdquo; The first reports of the bug, posted over five years ago (in November 2014) on consumer community platform getsatisfaction, have been reportedly ignored by the company. Another report submitted on the same platform, dated June 3, 2017, has seen the official TradingView account answer in the thread: &ldquo;Hi, you are right, we have a planned task to fix this. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.&rdquo; However, the problem apparently has not yet been solved. Cryptoteddybear claims that a company representative told him that he asked the technicians to increase the priority given to solving the bug. As Cointelegraph recently reported, TradingView is one of the platforms that added the &ldquo;CIX100&rdquo; index &mdash; an AI-powered index for the 100 strongest-performing cryptocurrencies and tokens. At the beginning of the current month, cryptocurrency analytics company Coin Metrics announced that it has acquired digital asset index firm Bletchley Indexes and plans to launch crypto smart beta indexes. As of press time, TradingView has not responded to a request for comment.",
