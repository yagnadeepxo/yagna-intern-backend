    "content": "Enabling Autonomous AI Agents to Make Payments: Challenges and Solutions\nBy David Paluy ‚Ä¢ Published on Apr 03, 2025\nIntroduction\n\nAutonomous AI agents are AI-driven software entities that can make independent decisions and perform tasks on behalf of a user or organization. A natural evolution of such agents is enabling them to handle financial transactions ‚Äì essentially making payments on behalf of users in various contexts (B2C purchases, B2B payments, internal enterprise expenses). This could mean a personal AI assistant paying bills or buying products for a consumer, an enterprise agent automating procurement payments, or even AI-to-AI transactions in supply chains. Enabling agents with spending power promises increased efficiency and 24/7 autonomy. However, it also introduces significant new considerations, as the existing payments infrastructure and rules have been built around human actors. In fact, dozens of startups and projects are now exploring ‚Äúagentic payments,‚Äù recognizing that today‚Äôs financial systems were ‚Äúexplicitly designed for humans, not bots,‚Äù and need adaptation to support autonomous agents. This report examines the core technical, legal, and ethical challenges of agent-initiated payments, surveys emerging tools and mechanisms (from virtual credit cards to crypto wallets), and proposes models for how such payments can be managed safely. It also compares different approaches and outlines near-term solutions versus longer-term innovations.\n\nIntroduction\nCore Challenges for Autonomous Agent Payments\nTechnical Challenges\nLegal & Regulatory Challenges\nEthical Challenges\nTools and Mechanisms for Agent Payments\nVirtual Credit Cards (VCCs)\nProgrammable Spending Cards and Accounts\nCryptocurrency Wallets and Smart Contracts\nTrust, Transparency, and User Control\nAdapting Existing Fintech Systems\nRole of AI and ML in Fraud Detection & Spend Control\nConceptual Models for Agent-Based Payment Flows\nShort-Term Solutions vs. Long-Term Innovations\nConclusion\nReferences and Links\nCore Challenges for Autonomous Agent Payments\n\nEnabling an AI agent to transact involves a convergence of technical, legal/regulatory, and ethical challenges. These must be addressed to ensure payments are executed correctly, securely, and in alignment with the user‚Äôs intent and society‚Äôs rules.\n\nTechnical Challenges\nIdentity & Authentication: Financial systems rely on identifying who is making a transaction (via logins, cardholder info, etc.). An AI agent has no legal identity of its own ‚Äì it operates under a user‚Äôs or organization‚Äôs identity. This creates ambiguity in authentication: how do we securely prove ‚Äúthis transaction was initiated by my authorized AI agent‚Äù and not a fraudster? Today‚Äôs payment products verify human identity (KYC, passwords, biometrics), which don‚Äôt directly apply to bots. We may need new authentication methods or digital certificates for agents. Some experts suggest extending the concept of Know-Your-Customer to ‚ÄúKnow-Your-Agent‚Äù ‚Äì verifying an agent‚Äôs identity/authorization as an intermediary acting for a user. Without robust identity, there‚Äôs risk of someone impersonating an agent or an agent going rogue.\nFraud Detection & Security: Current fraud detection engines are tuned to flag non-human patterns (e.g. bots attempting card theft). In fact, a major theme in fraud prevention is distinguishing automated attacks from genuine users. If we want certain bots (our agents) to transact, those systems need to be retrained to differentiate ‚Äúgood bots‚Äù from malicious ones. This is non-trivial ‚Äì it requires new behavioral models and possibly whitelisting or registering trusted agents. Additionally, agents can execute transactions faster and in greater volume than humans, which raises the stakes for any security lapse. A bug or exploit could trigger rapid, repeated payments. (A cautionary example is Knight Capital‚Äôs trading algorithm, which in 2012 went into an unintended loop and purchased $7 billion in stocks within an hour, nearly bankrupting the firm. Payment systems must guard against an agent executing incorrect instructions in a loop or being manipulated by adversarial inputs.\nPermissions and Limits: In human-driven finance, there are checks like daily transfer limits, spending caps, and step-up authentication for large amounts. With agents, we need analogous or even more granular constraints. We can‚Äôt simply remove limits to let agents operate freely ‚Äì that could be dangerous. Instead, we need programmable limits tied to context and goals (e.g. an agent can spend at most $500/day or $200 per transaction, only at certain merchants). These limits might be dynamic: an agent could have a smaller limit initially which grows as trust is established. Defining and enforcing such conditional limits is a technical challenge that spans both the agent‚Äôs design and the payment platform.\nIntegration with Payment Systems: Agents must interface with existing payment networks (cards, bank accounts, crypto networks). This requires APIs and credentials. Storing and using those credentials securely is critical ‚Äì e.g. API keys or virtual card numbers must be protected so that only the agent can use them. Managing secrets in an autonomous environment (possibly open-source agents) is a challenge. Additionally, many payment APIs assume a human or traditional server is initiating them. They may require things like two-factor authentication or CAPTCHA at points, which an agent would struggle with. Technical work is needed to create agent-friendly payment APIs or tools that allow an agent to trigger payments in a controlled way (some progress is being made, as discussed later).\nRegulatory Technical Constraints: For certain payment methods, giving an agent access can invoke compliance requirements. For example, if an agent is directly handling credit card data (PAN numbers, CVV), it could bring the interaction under PCI-DSS scope (the Payment Card Industry data security standards). This means the agent‚Äôs environment would need to be secure and audited like any payment processor ‚Äì a high bar for a general AI agent. One workaround is to use tokenization or virtual cards via APIs so the agent never ‚Äúsees‚Äù raw sensitive data (thus offloading PCI compliance to the provider). Technical solutions like secure enclaves or hardware security modules might be employed to let an agent initiate a payment without exposing sensitive credentials.\nReliability and Error Handling: An autonomous system must be robust against errors ‚Äì e.g., what if a payment fails or an amount is wrong? Humans can notice and correct such issues; an agent needs logic to detect anomalies (like a charged amount vastly different from expected) and react appropriately (perhaps by aborting or seeking confirmation). Building this error-handling and reconciliation ability (e.g., verifying that a payment was successful and perhaps logging a receipt) is another layer of complexity.\nLegal & Regulatory Challenges\nKYC and Ownership of Accounts: Financial regulations require that accounts and payment instruments are tied to real identities (for anti-money-laundering and fraud accountability). An AI agent cannot ‚Äúown‚Äù a bank account or credit card in the legal sense; the account will be in the name of a human or organization. This means any transaction the agent makes is legally the responsibility of that account owner. Today, users might share their card number or API key with an agent, essentially making the agent an extension of themselves. But this raises questions: if an agent misuses funds, can the user claim it was an unauthorized transaction? (Likely not easily, since it was technically authorized to use the credentials.) Liability frameworks may need updating. Some jurisdictions might require explicit user consent for an agent‚Äôs actions, treating the AI like a very literal power-of-attorney or ‚Äúdelegate‚Äù of the user.\nAuthorization & Consumer Protection: Many consumer protections assume a clear divide between user actions and fraud. If an agent makes a mistake (say, pays the wrong person or too much), it‚Äôs unclear how existing laws apply. For instance, credit card chargeback rights allow a consumer to dispute fraudulent charges ‚Äì but if the ‚Äúfraud‚Äù was an agent acting on bad info or a bug, the bank may say the charge isn‚Äôt unauthorized because the credentials were willingly given to the agent. We might need new rules or at least clear terms of service covering agent-initiated payments. Similarly, in the EU‚Äôs PSD2 regulations, Strong Customer Authentication requires two-factor auth for many online payments. If an AI agent is initiating a payment, it might not be feasible to involve the human for 2FA each time ‚Äì regulators may need to create extensions or exemptions for pre-authorized autonomous payments (similar to how they treat recurring payments or trusted beneficiaries today).\nRegulatory Compliance (AML, Sanctions, Reporting): When money moves, regulations around anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions screening apply. If an agent can pick payees autonomously, there‚Äôs a risk a compromised or poorly supervised agent could violate these laws (e.g., paying a blacklisted entity). Financial institutions will need to ensure that agent-initiated payments go through the same compliance checks as any other ‚Äì perhaps even extra checks if the agent‚Äôs decision process isn‚Äôt transparent. Additionally, regulations like GDPR (data protection) come into play: an agent handling financial data must protect user information. If agents store payment info or make decisions using personal data, those activities must be compliant (for example, if an agent is paying people, it may handle their personal data like names, account numbers ‚Äì raising privacy obligations).\nLack of Legal Personality: By law, only legal persons (individuals or registered organizations) can hold assets and enter contracts. An AI agent, no matter how autonomous, is not a legal person; it‚Äôs more akin to a tool or software service. This means any contract or payment an agent enters is on behalf of a human/legal entity. There is ongoing debate in legal circles about whether highly autonomous systems should have some form of legal status (some have likened it to a corporate entity or a ‚Äúelectronic personhood‚Äù), but currently there is no such framework. In practical terms, this places responsibility on the user or company deploying the agent. But it also means agents cannot assume legal responsibility. For example, if an agent signs a payment agreement or terms of service on a website when paying, the enforceability depends on whether the human owner is bound by the agent‚Äôs actions. Clear agreements are needed where users delegate authority to agents, possibly via terms that ‚Äúactions taken by the agent are as if done by the user.‚Äù Without such clarity, disputes could arise.\nLiability and Insurance: Who is liable if an agent causes financial loss? If it‚Äôs a bug in the agent‚Äôs software, the developer of the agent might be one party; the user who deployed it is another; the financial institution might also be involved. For instance, say an enterprise‚Äôs AI agent erroneously pays a fraudulent invoice, losing money ‚Äì the company might blame the AI vendor, while the vendor might invoke usage disclaimers. We may need new forms of insurance or liability contracts for autonomous agents (similar to how self-driving car liability is being approached). Businesses might need to explicitly insure against ‚ÄúAI operational mistakes.‚Äù Legally, having the user in the loop (even if just to review) provides safer harbor, which is why many early implementations will keep a human approval step for significant transactions. Over time, if laws evolve to accommodate autonomous decisions, we may see more freedom, but in 2025 this area is still grey.\nEthical and Compliance Alignment: Regulations also cover fairness and ethics in finance (e.g., fair lending laws, non-discrimination). If an AI agent is negotiating or making decisions involving payments (like deciding which supplier to pay or who to hire and pay), it must not violate these principles. Ensuring an agent‚Äôs decision-making process is auditable and free of illegal bias is important ‚Äì a challenge that merges legal and ethical domains.\nEthical Challenges\nTrust and Consent: Handing over one‚Äôs wallet (even a limited one) to an AI requires a leap of faith. Ethically, the user must fully consent to what the agent is allowed to do. This means clear communication about the agent‚Äôs powers and limits. There‚Äôs a risk of over-delegation: users might not realize what they‚Äôve authorized until after something goes wrong. Ensuring informed consent ‚Äì possibly through dashboards or explicit policy settings ‚Äì is an ethical imperative. If the agent is operating for a company, there‚Äôs also the trust of stakeholders (managers, finance department) that the agent will follow company policies. A history of reliability will be needed before people trust agents widely. Notably, consumer experiences with voice assistants (like Alexa‚Äôs failed attempt at automated purchasing) showed hesitation ‚Äì fear of misalignment with user intent was a key reason features like voice-shopping didn‚Äôt take off. Users feared the AI ‚Äúordering things I don‚Äôt want‚Äù or making mistakes. Building trust will be a gradual, iterative process.\nTransparency and Explainability: An ethical agent payment system should be transparent. Users should be able to find out why the agent made a particular purchase or payment. If the agent subscribed to a service or paid a supplier, it should log its reasoning (e.g., ‚ÄúService X was due for renewal and within budget, so I paid it to avoid interruption‚Äù). This traceability helps ensure the agent is acting in the user‚Äôs interest and allows auditing for any missteps. Opaque ‚Äúblack box‚Äù decisions that result in monetary loss are hard to accept. In sensitive contexts like healthcare payments or investing, explainability isn‚Äôt just nice-to-have but may be required for compliance or fiduciary reasons.\nPreventing Abuse and Misuse: There‚Äôs an ethical duty to ensure agents cannot easily be co-opted for wrongdoing. This includes external bad actors tricking the agent (through prompt hacking or manipulating its inputs) to send money to fraudsters. It also includes the possibility of the agent‚Äôs owner intentionally using it as a scapegoat for unethical behavior (‚ÄúOh, it wasn‚Äôt me who violated sanctions by paying that party, it was my rogue AI‚Äù). Designing the system such that all agent actions are traceable to an owner prevents a ‚Äúblame the AI‚Äù escape. Moreover, developers of agent payment systems should include safeguards against known fraud tactics ‚Äì for example, an agent might verify invoices or use sanity checks to avoid common scams (like ‚Äúchange of bank account‚Äù frauds). Ethically, if we create agents with financial power, we should imbue them with some fraud detection of their own or at least caution in suspicious scenarios.\nUser Control vs. Autonomy: There‚Äôs a balance to strike between giving the agent autonomy (so it‚Äôs useful) and maintaining user control (so it‚Äôs safe). Ethically, the user‚Äôs autonomy and intent should remain primary. The agent is an instrument of the user‚Äôs will, not an independent economic actor with its own goals. This may sound obvious, but with advanced AI there‚Äôs always a concern about the agent developing unintended objectives or pursuing a task at all costs (the classic ‚Äúalignment problem‚Äù). In finance, an misaligned agent could, say, decide the goal ‚Äúminimize expense‚Äù means it should cut corners or refuse payments that are actually important (imagine an agent that tries to save money by not paying a crucial vendor on time). Ensuring that the agent‚Äôs objectives are properly set by the user and that it knows when to defer to human judgment is an ethical design issue. Part of this is incorporating fail-safes: for example, an agent might pause and ask for confirmation if it encounters a situation not covered by its training or rules (‚ÄúThis expense is unusual, do you want me to proceed?‚Äù).\nImpacts on Stakeholders: Autonomous payments can have ripple effects. In B2B, if one company‚Äôs agents automatically negotiate and pay invoices, suppliers might need their own agents to keep up ‚Äì potentially shifting how business is conducted (speed, terms, etc.). Ethically, we should consider if smaller players or less tech-savvy users could be disadvantaged. Also, the employment impact: if AI agents handle accounts payable or procurement, human roles in those areas might change or diminish. Organizations deploying these agents have an ethical responsibility to manage the transition for employees (reskilling, etc.). Lastly, consider error impacts: if an agent makes a payment error, who bears the cost? Likely the user/company does ‚Äì so users must be made fully aware of the risks and have recourse or compensation mechanisms for agent failures (perhaps through insurance as mentioned, or vendor guarantees). Transparency about these policies is part of ethical use.\n\nIn summary, while autonomous agent payments promise efficiency, they sit at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and legacy financial norms. Identity/authentication hurdles, new fraud vectors, unclear liability, and trust issues must all be tackled before agents can freely spend on our behalf. The next sections explore solutions and tools that aim to address these challenges.\n\nTools and Mechanisms for Agent Payments\n\nTo empower AI agents with the ability to pay while managing the risks, a variety of financial tools and mechanisms are being explored. These range from leveraging existing fintech solutions (like virtual cards and spend management platforms) to using cryptocurrencies and smart contracts for more programmable control. Below, we examine key mechanisms and how they can be used in B2C, B2B, or enterprise settings to allow agent-initiated payments.\n\nVirtual Credit Cards (VCCs)\n\nVirtual credit cards are disposable or semi-permanent card numbers that can be created on-demand and tied to an underlying credit card or bank account. They carry a fixed spending limit and often can be restricted by use. For autonomous agents, VCCs are a straightforward way to grant spending access:\n\nHow they work: A virtual card typically has a 16-digit number, expiration, and CVV like a normal card, but no physical form. It can be used for online payments. Many banks or services (e.g., Capital One Eno, fintechs like Privacy.com, or corporate card providers) let users generate virtual card numbers instantly via API or app. You can usually set a maximum charge amount or an expiry date for each number.\nAgent usage: An AI agent could request a virtual card number via an API call when it needs to make a payment. For instance, if an agent is tasked with purchasing an item up to $50, it could obtain a VCC limited to $50 and use it at checkout. Because the VCC is unique to that transaction or vendor, if anything goes awry (the number is stolen or the agent tries to overspend), the damage is capped. Stripe‚Äôs early foray into agent payments uses this method ‚Äì Stripe‚Äôs developer toolkit for AI agents can generate virtual card numbers that the agent can use to pay external services. Essentially, the agent is given a temporary card with preset limits, solving the problem of how it ‚Äúcarries‚Äù a credit card.\nBenefits: Virtual cards leverage the ubiquity of the card network (nearly any online merchant accepts cards) while adding control. They can be single-use (one transaction then auto-close) or vendor-locked (only charges from a specific merchant ID will go through), which prevents misuse. Since they draw from an existing account, the user doesn‚Äôt have to pre-fund a new wallet; it‚Äôs using their normal credit line or balance, but safely partitioned. Risk is isolated: if an agent makes a mistake or a bad actor somehow gets the card info, that virtual card can be shut down without affecting the main account. Virtual cards are also familiar to the ecosystem, so using them is less likely to run into merchant-side issues.\nDrawbacks: VCCs share limitations of the card networks. They typically can‚Äôt be used for everything ‚Äì for example, paying another individual (P2P) or a bank transfer. They are best for traditional purchase scenarios (buying goods/services online). Also, managing many virtual cards could become complex (though automation helps) ‚Äì e.g., an active agent might generate dozens of card numbers per day; reconciling those to actual expenses and making sure unused ones are closed is a consideration. Additionally, while an agent can be given a VCC, some jurisdictions might still consider that ‚Äúthe user‚Äôs card.‚Äù If something goes wrong, the user is still on the hook for the charges initially. From a technical standpoint, using VCCs means the agent will handle card data ‚Äì which as noted implicates security. Ideally the agent would receive the card number via a secure API and not log it or store it beyond the payment session.\nUse cases: In consumer (B2C), a personal agent could use VCCs to, say, order groceries or pay for online subscriptions on behalf of the user. The user‚Äôs bank app might let them create a virtual card for the agent with a monthly limit for groceries. In enterprise (B2B), an agent could use a virtual corporate card to auto-pay SaaS subscriptions or online services needed for business, each limited to an amount per vendor. Because VCCs can often be tagged with descriptors, companies can track which expense was by which agent.\n\nOverall, virtual cards are a pragmatic short-term tool to let agents pay within controlled bounds. They piggyback on existing financial infrastructure (cards) while limiting exposure. As noted, Stripe and others are actively implementing this approach, indicating it‚Äôs one of the first viable steps for agent payments.\n\nProgrammable Spending Cards and Accounts\n\nMoving beyond one-off virtual cards, there are platforms that allow fully programmable payment cards or bank accounts. These are highly relevant for giving AI agents ongoing spending capability with guardrails.\n\nCard Issuing APIs: Fintech services like Stripe Issuing, Marqeta, and others provide APIs to create and manage cards (both virtual and physical) with custom rules. For example, Stripe Issuing‚Äôs API allows developers to create employee expense cards, set spend limits, and even restrict merchant categories. Through these APIs, you can do things like: ‚ÄúCreate a card for Agent X, allow only $1000 total spend, max $100 per transaction, only at travel-related merchants (hotels, airlines), and have it expire in 60 days.‚Äù This is powerful for enterprise use. An AI agent given such a card effectively has a company-sanctioned credit card, but one that the company can monitor and control in real-time. If the agent tries something outside its bounds, the transaction simply declines. This is similar to how companies issue corporate cards to employees with limits ‚Äì but here the ‚Äúemployee‚Äù is an AI. The difference is, with an AI we might want even tighter control (like per-transaction approvals or automated freezes on certain triggers). The API nature of these services means the controls can be adjusted dynamically by software, which is ideal for integration with an AI governance system.\nApproval and Limit Workflows: In an enterprise scenario, you could integrate an agent‚Äôs spending with approval workflows. For instance, an agent needing to make a $5,000 purchase might automatically generate a request that goes to a manager‚Äôs queue; once approved, the agent‚Äôs card limit could be temporarily raised or a one-time token issued to complete that purchase. Some modern spend management platforms (Ramp, Brex, etc.) already allow setting approval requirements for employee-initiated transactions ‚Äì adapting these for AI agents is a small leap. In fact, giving an AI its own card under the company‚Äôs account is analogous to giving a new team member a card, just with perhaps more stringent rules.\nNeobank Accounts with APIs: Similarly, on the banking side, some banking-as-a-service providers let you create sub-accounts with their own balances and transaction limits. An AI agent could be assigned a sub-account; it can only spend funds from that account. The business or user periodically tops up the sub-account (creating a budget envelope, effectively). The agent uses payment APIs (ACH transfers, wire, instant payments) from that account. Because the account is separate, if the agent messes up, the damage is confined to that sub-account‚Äôs balance. The controls at the bank level (like not allowing overdraft or flagging unusual payees) still apply. This is more relevant for B2B payments where card rails might not be used (e.g., paying invoices via bank transfer).\nProgrammability and APIs: The key advantage of using these modern fintech solutions is flexibility. We can programmatically set rules like: spending limits that reset periodically, merchant whitelists/blacklists, time-based restrictions (maybe an agent can only spend during business hours or only this week), and multi-factor authentication triggers (e.g., require a second API call confirmation for transactions over X). For example, infrastructure is emerging that can ‚Äúgenerate single-use payment credentials, set strict spending limits, restrict transactions to specific merchants, and require human approval above thresholds‚Äù ‚Äì exactly the toolkit needed to manage agent spending. These capabilities, once integrated, give fine-grained control to balance autonomy and safety.\nTransparency and Monitoring: Cards and accounts issued in this way can feed into dashboards and reports. So, a company could in real-time see Agent A spent $200 on AWS, Agent B spent $50 on an API service, etc. This real-time visibility is crucial for trust (addressed more in the next section on transparency). For instance, one startup (Skyfire) that focuses on agent payments provides a dashboard to ‚Äúview exactly how much, and where, their agent is spending.‚Äù Such dashboards likely leverage the underlying card/account APIs to pull transaction data.\nExamples: A concrete scenario: imagine an internal enterprise agent that auto-scales cloud infrastructure. It needs to pay the cloud provider when new servers are added. The company could issue a virtual card to this agent with a monthly cap of say $10,000. The agent‚Äôs code uses this card to pay the cloud bills as they come due. The system might restrict the card to only work with that cloud provider (merchant lock) for security. If the cloud bill spikes unexpectedly, the agent might hit its limit and then pause or seek approval, rather than bankrupting the budget. Another example on the consumer side: an AI shopping assistant on your phone could have a ‚Äúvirtual debit card‚Äù linked to your account but with maybe $200 limit per week and perhaps only for a list of stores you approved. If the AI finds a good deal and wants to purchase it for you, it uses that card ‚Äì you get an immediate notification and can intervene if needed. If everything is good, the purchase goes through under the hood; if not, you cancel the virtual card.\nChallenges: While powerful, these programmable solutions require that the user or company is able to get access to such an API platform. Large enterprises might partner with fintech providers or use in-house solutions. Individual consumers have fewer options, though some challenger banks and budgeting apps do give multiple virtual card features. Another challenge is ensuring the programming of limits truly aligns with the agent‚Äôs goals ‚Äì setting them too tight might cause the agent to fail at its task, too loose and you defeat the purpose. There‚Äôs also the risk of complexity: managing potentially many rules across many agents could get unwieldy, calling for an ‚Äúagent spend policy manager‚Äù of sorts in the future.\n\nIn summary, programmable cards/accounts provide a robust way to give agents spending power with guardrails. They effectively let us ‚Äúcodify policy in the payment instrument‚Äù ‚Äì a very direct method of risk mitigation. This approach is well-suited for enterprise and high-trust scenarios where the overhead of setting up these systems is justified by the value of automation.\n\nCryptocurrency Wallets and Smart Contracts\n\nCryptocurrency and blockchain-based payment systems offer an alternative route for agent payments. They are inherently digital and programmable, which aligns well with autonomous agents. Two main modes exist here: custodial wallets (where a third-party service holds crypto or fiat for the agent) and non-custodial smart contract wallets (where the agent itself interacts with a blockchain directly, under set rules).\n\nCustodial Wallets (Including Stablecoins): A custodial setup means a service (such as a crypto exchange or a specialized payment platform) holds funds for the user and exposes an API for the agent. The funds could be in fiat currency or tokenized as stablecoins for on-chain use. The agent doesn‚Äôt hold the private keys; instead, it has API credentials to instruct the custodian to send payments. For example, an agent could use an exchange‚Äôs API to send 0.1 ETH to an address to pay for some service, or use a stablecoin custody service to pay $100 in USDC to a supplier‚Äôs wallet. The advantage is the custodian handles all the blockchain interactions, security of keys, and often compliance (KYC/AML on accounts). This is similar to how a traditional bank API might work, but with crypto as the medium one step in. Skyfire‚Äôs network is an example: businesses deposit USD with Skyfire, which converts it to USDC (a stablecoin) under the hood and assigns it to the agent‚Äôs digital wallet, then the agent transacts in USDC on the network. From the user perspective, it‚Äôs like a special bank account for the agent; under the hood it‚Äôs crypto facilitating fast, programmable transfers. Custodial approaches can also seamlessly convert back to fiat ‚Äì e.g., the agent could pay a vendor in crypto which the vendor‚Äôs side immediately converts to local currency.\n\nPros: The heavy lifting (security, speed, compliance) is handled by the service. The agent just calls an API ‚Äì simpler integration. Also, transactions can be instant and global if using crypto rails (no waiting for bank hours). Custodians can often provide added safeguards: for instance, they might implement spending limits or risk checks on outgoing transactions (much like a bank would).\nCons: Trusting a custodian means you rely on that third party‚Äôs solvency and security. It also means the user doesn‚Äôt fully control funds ‚Äì if the custodian has an outage or freezes the account suspecting issues, the agent is stopped. Additionally, using a custodian often involves fees (Skyfire, for example, charges a percentage per transaction. From a regulatory view, custodians are typically regulated entities (money transmitters or the like), which can be positive (more accountability) but also could limit availability (KYC requirements, not available in all regions, etc.).\nUse cases: A business might use a custodial wallet service to give its AI agent a small treasury in crypto to automate micropayments across borders (since a stablecoin transfer can be cheaper and quicker than international bank payments). Or an individual could top up an agent‚Äôs account on a platform with $100 in stablecoin to let it buy digital goods or IoT services that accept crypto. Custodial solutions often act as a bridge ‚Äì e.g., the agent pays a SaaS API in crypto via the custodian, and the SaaS provider might auto-convert that to USD on their end. This offloads the need for both sides to handle multiple currencies.\n\nSmart Contract Wallets (Non-Custodial): In a non-custodial approach, the agent (or user) holds the private keys to a crypto wallet ‚Äì ideally a smart contract-based wallet that can enforce rules. Blockchains like Ethereum support smart contract accounts where one can encode spending policies: multi-signature (requiring multiple approvals), daily spending limits, whitelisted addresses, and more. By giving an agent access to such a wallet, you can imbue it with programmatic constraints at the wallet level. For example, a smart wallet could be coded to allow at most 1 ETH of spending per day and only to certain contract addresses (perhaps known service providers). If the agent tries to send more, the blockchain transaction itself will fail the rule, no central authority needed. This is powerful because it‚Äôs trustless enforcement ‚Äì even if the agent is compromised, it cannot violate the hard-coded limits of the wallet. Multi-signature is another feature: you could set it so that any transaction above a threshold requires a second signature (which could be the user‚Äôs mobile wallet or a co-signer service). This is analogous to requiring human approval for big spends, but executed via cryptographic rules. Smart wallets can also have social recovery or admin keys, so the user can revoke the agent‚Äôs access if needed by changing keys.\n\nPros: Extremely flexible and autonomous. The wallet can operate 24/7 and doesn‚Äôt rely on third parties once deployed. Payments can be fully programmable: you could implement complex logic like ‚Äúallow $X per day unless a specific event, then allow $Y,‚Äù etc. Also, crypto wallets can interact directly with decentralized services ‚Äì for example, an agent could not only pay but also enter into smart contracts, escrow funds, trade on decentralized exchanges, etc., all under predefined constraints. This opens the door to agent-driven DeFi activities (though that‚Äôs an advanced scenario). With blockchain, microtransactions are feasible (depending on fees) and can be as low as fractions of a cent on some networks ‚Äì enabling pay-per-task at scale. Another benefit is that on some newer networks (or with Ethereum‚Äôs upcoming account abstraction features), one can pay transaction fees in stablecoin or have fees sponsored, making it easier for an agent to operate without needing to manage gas in multiple tokens.\nCons: The main challenge is that the wider world still runs on fiat. If an agent‚Äôs wallet is full of crypto, but the vendor it needs to pay doesn‚Äôt accept crypto, you need a bridge (which often means a custodian or a crypto card). There‚Äôs progress ‚Äì for instance, Visa has piloted letting businesses settle in USDC stablecoin, which blurs the line ‚Äì but generally an on-chain payment will eventually hit an off-chain interface. Another con is complexity: developing and auditing a secure smart contract wallet is non-trivial. Bugs in the wallet code could be disastrous (though one can use standardized, audited templates). Also, users have to manage keys ‚Äì if the key controlling the agent‚Äôs wallet is lost or compromised, funds can be lost (though social recovery can mitigate that). In terms of regulation, non-custodial crypto is more on the user ‚Äì you‚Äôre bypassing regulated intermediaries. This gives freedom but also responsibility to follow laws like reporting gains, ensuring you‚Äôre not transacting with sanctioned addresses (tools exist for compliance on-chain, but it‚Äôs a new area). Scalability is another consideration: major blockchains can have congestion or high fees at times, which could hamper an agent that needs frequent transactions ‚Äì but layer-2 networks and alternative blockchains can address this (and many agent applications could run on those).\nUse cases: A possible use case is machine-to-machine (M2M) payments. Imagine an electric car that is an autonomous agent: it could have a smart contract wallet that automatically pays charging stations or tolls in crypto as it uses them. Each payment might be tiny, but executed on the fly without human involvement, using a predefined budget in the wallet. Another use: An AI content creator agent that sells its outputs could accept crypto from buyer agents and automatically split the revenue (maybe sending a portion to its owner, a portion to a developer, etc.) according to a smart contract. This is essentially an on-chain business run by agents. While these scenarios are still experimental, the autonomy and programmability of smart contracts align naturally with autonomous agents, as noted by various industry experts who see blockchain as a key infrastructure for the ‚ÄúAI agent economy.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs worth mentioning that hybrid models exist too: for example, an agent could use crypto for certain transactions (for programmability or global reach) and traditional payments for others, depending on context. Also, crypto protocols are evolving that specifically cater to agents ‚Äì e.g., projects that let agents have decentralized identities and reputation on-chain, which can be tied to wallets for trust.\n\nIn summary, crypto wallets (especially smart contract-based) offer the maximum programmability and global interoperability for agent payments, which is a huge opportunity. They remove many constraints of legacy systems (no need to fit into human-oriented anti-bot measures, no 9-5 banking hours, etc.). However, integrating them with the existing economy and ensuring security introduces new challenges. Custodial wallets serve as a more immediate stepping stone, bridging between the traditional fiat world and the crypto world ‚Äì giving agents some benefits of crypto (like instant settlement) without all the complexity, at the cost of some centralization. As the landscape matures, we may see increasing use of crypto rails for agents, especially for microtransactions and cross-border interactions where they hold strong advantages.\n\n(Next, we consider how to maintain trust and control when using these payment tools, and how existing fintech infrastructure can adapt to support agent transactions.)\n\nTrust, Transparency, and User Control\n\nBecause autonomous payments can be risky, implementing strong trust and control mechanisms is critical. The user (or business) needs confidence that the agent will act only within approved bounds and that they can monitor and override its actions. Here we discuss how to achieve transparency and maintain user control, even as agents operate with some independence.\n\nGranular Spending Controls: As introduced earlier, one of the primary ways to trust an agent is to limit what it can do. This includes setting spending limits ‚Äì e.g., an agent can spend at most $X per day or per week. Many implementations are doing exactly this. For example, Skyfire‚Äôs agent wallets allow businesses to deposit a set amount and set limits on how much an AI agent can spend in one transaction and over time. If the agent tries to exceed those limits, the system will block it and ‚Äúping a human to review it.‚Äù. This kind of control ensures that even if an agent misbehaves or is hacked, it cannot drain more than the allotted amount without human intervention. Besides monetary limits, other dimensions of control include merchant or category restrictions (the agent can only spend at approved vendors or types of services), and time-based restrictions (e.g., only allow transactions during certain hours or only allow a certain number of transactions per day). The use of single-use or task-specific credentials enhances this: if each payment requires generating a new virtual credential with tight limits, the scope of any single failure is contained. Essentially, these controls act as automated approval policies that the agent must live within.\nReal-Time Alerts and Approvals: Even with limits, it‚Äôs important the user is kept in the loop, especially for larger or unusual transactions. Agents should be integrated with notification systems ‚Äì e.g., push notifications or emails to the user whenever the agent spends money. This mirrors what many banks do for card transactions, but here it‚Äôs even more critical as the user didn‚Äôt directly initiate the action. If an agent attempts something outside its normal pattern or above a threshold, an approval workflow should kick in. The earlier example from Skyfire shows one approach: attempts over the limit trigger a human review. Similarly, the list of controls from Stripe‚Äôs toolkit and others includes ‚Äúrequire human approval above thresholds.‚Äù. This could be implemented via a mobile app where the user taps ‚Äúallow‚Äù or via an email link, etc. The goal is to stop runaway spending while minimally impacting useful autonomous operation. Over time, as trust builds, some thresholds might be raised, but the mechanism stays as a safety net.\nTransparency Dashboards: Users and organizations will want to see what agents are doing with funds at a glance. A dashboard that shows all agent transactions, budgets remaining, pending approvals, and any policy violations is essential. This is already part of some solutions ‚Äì e.g., Skyfire offers a dashboard for exactly this. In an enterprise scenario, such dashboards might integrate with existing expense tracking or ERP systems. They not only build trust (because everything is visible) but also help in auditing and accounting. For instance, an enterprise could require that the agent attaches a note or a receipt for each payment (the agent could be programmed to save confirmation pages or invoices). These records then flow into accounting systems like any other expense. Transparency also means clarity on the agent‚Äôs authority: clearly delineating which payments were made by AI (perhaps tagged differently in statements) versus by humans could be part of compliance reporting. Some financial institutions might even mark transactions initiated via an API/agent with a flag in their data ‚Äì allowing different handling or filtering.\nKnow Your Agent (KYA) and Verification: As mentioned, financial institutions are considering services akin to KYC but for AI agents. The idea is to have a trusted third-party or the financial institution itself validate an agent‚Äôs identity and the link to its owner. This could involve issuing a digital certificate or token to the agent that it presents with each transaction (proving ‚ÄúI am the AI agent authorized by Alice, client of Bank X‚Äù). If widely adopted, this could greatly improve trust in the ecosystem: merchants and banks could accept payments from verified agents more readily. Mastercard, for instance, has hinted that verifying agents could be a new role for financial institutions. In practice, this might mean when you create an agent, you register it with your bank which then gives it a sort of sub-identity. Later, the bank can assure any recipient that ‚ÄúPayment coming from Agent123 is backed by Alice‚Äôs account and policy.‚Äù This prevents random bots from masquerading as legitimate. It‚Äôs a form of digital identity for non-human actors. While still conceptual, it aligns with how trust could be scaled ‚Äì similar to how SSL certificates let web servers trust each other, agent certificates could allow payment networks to trust agent-initiated actions.\nUser Override and Emergency Stop: At any point, the user should have the ability to pause or stop an agent from spending. This might be as simple as a ‚Äúfreeze card‚Äù button that instantly shuts off the agent‚Äôs virtual card or empties its budget to $0. It could also be a ‚Äúpause agent‚Äù command that the agent‚Äôs platform listens to, causing the agent to halt all operations (not just payments). Knowing that they can quickly intervene gives users confidence to let the agent act in the first place. Additionally, there should be clear procedures if something goes wrong ‚Äì e.g., how to dispute a payment the agent made in error, how to recover funds (if possible), or how to hold the agent‚Äôs creator accountable if it was a software flaw. In enterprise settings, this might translate to an admin console where administrators can disable an agent‚Äôs financial privileges if it behaves unexpectedly.\nAudit Trails and Accountability: Every payment an agent makes should have an audit trail attributing it to the agent (and thus the user/company). For internal use, this helps in tracing decisions (‚Äúwe paid this supplier because the agent thought stock was low, here‚Äôs the log‚Äù). For external accountability, if an agent ever does something malicious (say it was subverted to launder money), investigators need a trail to the owner. Embedding metadata in transactions that reference the agent ID (where possible) or logging it in internal bank logs can facilitate this. It‚Äôs part of transparency ‚Äì not only does the user see what the agent did, but the system as a whole keeps a record for accountability. This is analogous to having CCTV in a store where a robot is operating ‚Äì you trust it more if you know there‚Äôs a record of its actions.\nUser Education and Control Interfaces: To truly feel in control, users must be educated on how the agent operates and what controls they have. This means the UI/UX around agent payments is important. For example, a user should easily grasp the budgets and limits in place (perhaps with a simple slider or setting: ‚ÄúAgent can spend up to $50/week‚Äù). They should receive clear notifications of agent activity in plain language (‚ÄúYour travel agent bot spent $300 on Delta Airlines for your flight to NYC‚Äù). If something looks off, the user should know how to query or correct the agent. In some cases, providing an explanation interface ‚Äì the agent could be asked ‚ÄúWhy did you make this payment?‚Äù and it should answer ‚Äì can greatly enhance trust through transparency. It ties into the explainability point in ethics.\nBuilding Trust Gradually: Initially, many users will likely only be comfortable with agents making very small or low-stakes payments. Over time, as they see the agent perform reliably, trust can increase. Systems should allow this gradual escalation: maybe start with a $20 limit, then $100, then higher as needed. Each successful cycle where the agent stays in bounds will build trust. It‚Äôs similar to how one might start an intern or new employee with small purchasing authority and increase it as they prove trustworthy. The difference is an AI agent‚Äôs trustworthiness is a function of its design and testing, but from a user perspective, seeing it ‚Äúin the wild‚Äù behaving correctly is crucial. Providers of agent payment tools might even incorporate trust scoring ‚Äì e.g., an agent that has operated for 6 months without issues could be given a higher trust level which streamlines some of its transactions.\n\nIn essence, no one wants a runaway AI with a blank check. By imposing strict limits, monitoring continuously, and creating mechanisms for human oversight, we ensure that users remain in charge of their agents‚Äô finances. The combination of preventative controls (limits, whitelists), real-time oversight (notifications, dashboards), and after-the-fact accountability (logs, audits) addresses the major trust barriers. Transparency features ‚Äì from dashboards to potential KYA certifications ‚Äì give all parties (users, banks, merchants) confidence that an agent‚Äôs money is good and its behavior is accountable. These measures, many of which are being incorporated into early agent-payment offerings, make the difference between a terrifying prospect of uncontrolled AI spending and a practical, manageable tool that extends human capability.\n\nAdapting Existing Fintech Systems\n\nThe current financial ecosystem ‚Äì banks, payment networks, fraud engines, etc. ‚Äì was not built with autonomous AI agents in mind. To accommodate agentic payments, these systems will need to adapt. Fortunately, many modern fintech systems are flexible and software-driven, which means they can evolve relatively quickly. Here‚Äôs how key components of the financial world could be adapted or leveraged to support autonomous agents making payments:\n\nBanks and Neobanks with Open APIs: Traditional banks often have rigid processes for payments and may not allow third-party automation easily, but the rise of open banking and Banking-as-a-Service means more banks provide APIs. Neobanks (digital-first banks) in particular usually expose RESTful APIs to create accounts, initiate payments (ACH, SEPA, wire), and check balances. By using these, an agent can interact with a bank almost as a human would, but programmatically. For example, a neobank could let a user create multiple sub-accounts via API; a user could designate one sub-account for an AI agent and set its balance as the agent‚Äôs budget. The agent, via an API token, could initiate payments from that sub-account to vendors. This essentially uses existing bank plumbing (like ACH transfers) but in a controlled sandbox (the sub-account). Many banks already allow scheduling payments or rule-based triggers (like ‚Äúsweep money if balance above X‚Äù); extending this to respond to agent requests is conceivable. What might banks need to change? Perhaps their risk models for API usage ‚Äì if an agent is hitting the API frequently to, say, pay dozens of $1 invoices, the bank‚Äôs systems should recognize this as intended activity, not fraud. Banks might also develop new account types or user roles for AI agents ‚Äì e.g., sub-accounts tagged as ‚Äúbot account‚Äù that have certain restrictions. Neobanks and BaaS providers are likely to lead the way, as they can implement these features faster and partner with fintech developers to support agent use cases.\nCard Networks and Processors: Visa, MasterCard, and card processors (Stripe, Adyen, etc.) currently treat most transactions as originating from a human cardholder. As autonomous usage grows, networks might introduce flags in the transaction data to indicate an AI agent is the one initiating. Why? Because then if a transaction looks bot-like (fast, repetitive), the network won‚Äôt automatically decline it thinking it‚Äôs fraud ‚Äì it knows this is an authorized agent. They might also adapt their authorization protocols: for example, an agent could sign transactions with a digital certificate that the processor can verify (a bit like how 3D Secure verifies an issuer knows the customer). Mastercard‚Äôs concept of ‚ÄúKYA‚Äù identification services suggests they foresee a role in helping authenticate agents to merchants. On the acquiring side (merchants), payment gateways might need updates too ‚Äì e.g., some e-commerce sites use CAPTCHA or other bot detections at checkout. If the agent is a ‚Äúgood bot‚Äù the merchant wants to allow (because it‚Äôs a customer‚Äôs agent), there may need to be a way to bypass such measures. Perhaps an API-based checkout flow for agents separate from the web UI. Stripe, for instance, has been exploring optimized checkouts for AI agents. If this becomes common, card networks may formalize standards for machine-initiated transactions, which could include extra data fields like ‚Äúagent ID‚Äù or a tag indicating no 3D Secure challenge needed due to pre-authorization. It‚Äôs analogous to how recurring transactions have indicators so they are not declined for lack of 3D Secure each time. In short, networks can adapt by recognizing new categories of payers (agents) and adjusting fraud rules, authentication steps, and data formats accordingly.\nFraud and Risk Engines: The fraud prevention systems used by banks and payment processors will need re-tuning. Currently, if they see a flurry of transactions from one account in seconds, or perfectly regular interval payments, they might flag it as a bot or script attack. In the agent world, that might be normal (e.g., an agent pays 100 microtransactions per minute for an API usage fee). These engines have to learn what ‚Äúnormal‚Äù looks like for each authorized agent, which could be very different from human patterns. This likely means applying machine learning on transaction data to cluster and identify agent behavior profiles vs human profiles. They need to flip the paradigm from ‚Äúblock anything that looks automated‚Äù to ‚Äúblock anything that looks maliciously automated, but allow known-good automation.‚Äù This is a nuanced challenge. One approach is incorporating the agent‚Äôs identity and history into fraud scoring: if an agent is known and has a whitelist, transactions matching its expected profile (right merchant, under limit, etc.) get a low risk score. If something falls outside (wrong merchant or time), even if an agent is sending it, it could indicate a compromise and thus be flagged. We might also see entirely new fraud startups focusing on agent transactions ‚Äì as QED investors speculated, separating good bots from bad bots is a new fraud paradigm to conquer. Traditional players like Stripe have sophisticated fraud systems (Radar) which they‚Äôll likely extend to agent-based scenarios. In practice, an adaptation could be as simple as adding a setting: ‚Äúthis API key corresponds to an AI agent for user X, allow higher frequency transactions but enforce these specific rules‚Ä¶‚Äù. Over time, as data accumulates, AI/ML models can be trained specifically on agent behavior to detect rogue events (like an agent suddenly sending funds to an unusual recipient might indicate it‚Äôs compromised or acting out of scope). In essence, fraud engines will move from a binary human/bot decision to a multi-class decision: human, trusted agent, unknown automation, malicious bot, etc., each with different handling.\nEnterprise Systems (ERP, Procurement, Accounting): Within companies, payments by agents should integrate with existing workflows. For example, if an AI agent is ordering supplies and making payments, those need to show up in the accounting system with proper coding (which department, which expense category, etc.). Enterprises likely will adapt their ERP to treat an AI agent somewhat like an employee or a procurement system user. Policies that already exist (like ‚Äúpurchases over $1000 require manager approval‚Äù) should be enforced on agents too. This can be done by connecting the agent to the same approval workflow tools. For instance, if an agent wants to pay an invoice, it could first create a request in the ERP; once approved, it gets a green light to actually execute the payment. Over time, if trust in the agent is high, the ERP might auto-approve routine things (like invoices under a certain amount that match a purchase order) for the agent, whereas a human might have needed to click approve. Additionally, internal audit and compliance teams will adapt by auditing agent decisions just as they would a human‚Äôs ‚Äì maybe even more rigorously at first. This might involve reviewing the agent‚Äôs logs, ensuring the rules set up for it match company policy, and testing it (audit might simulate a scenario to see if the agent appropriately flags something). Fortunately, many enterprises already use a lot of automation in payments (like scheduled vendor payments, rule-based invoice approval), so an AI agent extends that rather than introduces something completely foreign. It‚Äôs more about the AI making judgment calls (like selecting a vendor or timing a payment) which previously were human decisions. Ensuring those align with internal controls is the focus.\nTooling for Dynamic Governance: We touched on dynamic spend governance earlier in concept; here‚Äôs how existing systems could help. Some payment platforms allow dynamic rules ‚Äì e.g., one could integrate a machine learning model in a decision engine that decides to approve or decline transactions in real-time. These decision engines (offered by companies like Feedzai, Featurespace, or even in-house at banks) could incorporate an agent‚Äôs context. For example, an enterprise could feed data to the engine like ‚ÄúAgent A‚Äôs current task load is high, it‚Äôs expected to spend more on cloud services today‚Äù so the engine doesn‚Äôt flag the surge as fraud but still watches for other anomalies. AI can also help govern budgets by predicting if an agent might exceed budget given its current run rate, and alerting finance proactively. Existing spend management tools (like those that track monthly burn rate) can be adapted to include agent spending and even simulate scenarios (‚Äúif we let the AI order inventory autonomously, what‚Äôs the projected spending?‚Äù). Essentially, existing fintech and finance tools will need small tweaks to accommodate an additional actor (AI agent) in the workflows, and possibly more real-time, event-driven handling rather than end-of-month reporting. The good news is that the trend in fintech has been towards more automation and real-time control anyway, so agentic payments push further in a direction already underway.\nNetwork Collaboration: Adapting systems is not just within one bank or company ‚Äì there may be industry-wide collaboration needed. For instance, creating standards for agent identity (as noted, possibly via something like a KYA service) might involve banks, tech companies, and regulators working together. Payment networks might develop best practices for merchants to handle agent-driven transactions (like how to design an API for an ‚Äúagent checkout‚Äù). Fraud info sharing might also expand: if one bank identifies a pattern of a malicious AI script trying stolen cards, that intel can be shared across the network to blacklist that agent fingerprint. Organizations like PCI Security Standards Council might eventually consider guidelines for machine-to-machine payments security. In adapting existing systems, human cooperation and setting common rules is as important as the tech adjustments.\n\nIn summary, existing fintech infrastructure doesn‚Äôt need a complete overhaul to accommodate AI agents, but it does need tweaks and new layers. Open APIs and banking services provide entry points for agents, card networks and fraud systems need to update their models of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù behavior, and enterprise processes must loop agents into their controls. Many of these adaptations are extensions of digital banking trends (API banking, customizable card controls, real-time risk scoring). The unique twist is accommodating an autonomous decision-maker. The faster incumbents adapt, the less friction agent payments will encounter. It‚Äôs likely we‚Äôll see innovative fintechs bridging gaps in the meantime ‚Äì for example, companies offering ‚Äúagent payment as a service‚Äù that wrap around existing rails to make them agent-friendly (some startups are already essentially doing this, by building on top of Stripe/Bank APIs as a wrapper for agents. Over time, if agent-based commerce becomes significant, the mainstream players (banks, networks) will natively support these use cases, just as they eventually embraced online payments and mobile wallets in the past.\n\nRole of AI and ML in Fraud Detection & Spend Control\n\nIronically, while AI agents introduce new risks in payments, AI and machine learning themselves are key tools to mitigate those risks. AI/ML can enhance fraud detection, enforce dynamic controls, and even supervise agent behavior in real-time. Here‚Äôs how advanced algorithms play a role in keeping agent-initiated payments safe and well-governed:\n\n‚ÄúGood Bot‚Äù vs ‚ÄúBad Bot‚Äù Classification: As previously mentioned, a crucial challenge is distinguishing legitimate agent transactions from malicious ones. Traditional systems often labeled anything non-human as ‚Äúbad,‚Äù but now we have a class of ‚Äúgood automation.‚Äù Machine learning can be trained to recognize patterns of trusted agents. This might involve features like: transaction timing patterns, typical merchant categories, amount ranges, IP address or environment from which requests originate, etc. Over many observations, an ML model could build a profile for each agent. For example, Agent Alice usually makes small purchases in US dollars, between 9am-5pm, from servers on AWS in the US. If suddenly a transaction comes at 3am from an IP in another country for a large amount in a different currency, the model would flag it as outlier behavior (potentially a hijacked agent or fraudulent attempt). Conversely, the model would learn to approve transactions that fit the agent‚Äôs normal pattern very quickly and with low friction. This dynamic profiling is more flexible than static rules (which might be too strict or too loose) and can adapt as the agent‚Äôs role evolves.\nAdaptive Fraud Detection: Fraud schemes will adapt to agents as well ‚Äì for example, criminals might target vulnerabilities in how agents operate. AI-driven fraud detection can notice subtler clues than rule-based systems. For instance, if multiple agents across different users start making a similar odd payment, that might indicate a widespread attack (like an injection of a malicious prompt across the platform). Anomaly detection algorithms could catch that emerging pattern and alert operators. Additionally, AI can fuse data points: not just transaction data, but maybe logs from the agent‚Äôs decision process (if accessible) or other contextual info. For example, if an enterprise agent suddenly makes an unauthorized payment, an AI system might correlate it with a spike in network traffic or error logs on that agent, suggesting it was compromised by malware ‚Äì something a transaction-only fraud check wouldn‚Äôt know. Thus, AI systems overseeing agents might integrate multiple data streams (cybersecurity logs, agent behavior logs, and financial transactions) to make holistic decisions about risk. This is an advanced form of fraud detection that blends IT security and payment security ‚Äì likely important in enterprise contexts.\nDynamic Spend Governance: Traditional spending controls are static (fixed limits, etc.), but AI can make them dynamic. For example, suppose an agent normally shouldn‚Äôt spend over $1000/day, but today it‚Äôs encountering an emergency (say, cloud costs spiked due to a DDoS attack it is mitigating). A dynamic system might recognize the anomaly in context and temporarily raise the agent‚Äôs spending cap to allow it to handle the situation, while simultaneously flagging this to admins. This could prevent a rigid rule from crippling operations, yet keep oversight. Conversely, if an agent that usually spends $1000/day suddenly has no legitimate need (as per its task pipeline) but tries to spend $5000, an AI system might intervene and lower the thresholds or require extra verification because it predicts this is likely an error or malicious. These adjustments can be done by predictive models that forecast an agent‚Äôs spending needs and compare to set budgets. If the forecast exceeds budget, it can alert or adjust. If actual spending deviates from forecast in a concerning way, it can clamp down. Essentially, it‚Äôs a feedback loop where AI monitors and tunes the agent‚Äôs ‚Äúleash‚Äù in real time.\nAI as a Watcher Agent: We can think of deploying AI to watch AI. For instance, a ‚Äúguardian AI‚Äù could monitor transaction streams and agent communications to ensure compliance with rules. If something looks off, the guardian can step in or notify a human. This is analogous to human managers overseeing employees, but here an AI manager oversees AI workers. In finance, this could be very effective ‚Äì an AI overseer could check every proposed payment against a set of complex rules and contexts far faster than a human could. We already see glimmers of this in some systems: for example, AI that monitors trading algorithms to prevent accidents. A guardian AI might catch that an agent is repeatedly trying a payment that‚Äôs failing and pause it (to avoid, say, dozens of duplicate charges), or notice that two different agents are interacting in a way that could be collusive or unintended. While somewhat futuristic, it underscores that as we give AI agents autonomy, we can also employ AI oversight to manage that autonomy at scale.\nPreventing Fraudulent Agents: Another angle is using AI to scrutinize the agents themselves when they‚Äôre onboarded. If third-party developers create AI agents (say an app or skill you install), one might use AI analysis to vet the code or behavior in a sandbox. This could catch if an agent is likely to misbehave (for example, if it tries to send data to an unknown server or make external calls it shouldn‚Äôt). Though more about cybersecurity, it feeds into payment protection by reducing the chance a malicious or poorly written agent ever gets control of funds. AI tools for code analysis or policy compliance could be part of the agent deployment pipeline, especially in enterprises that might use many AI agents from various vendors.\nContinuous Learning and Improvement: As agentic payments are new, there will be a learning curve. AI/ML systems excel at improving with more data. Every incident (be it a false decline, a fraud case, or an agent error) can be fed back into the model to refine it. Over time, the fraud detection AI might discover new features that indicate risk (maybe something like ‚Äúwhen Agent X‚Äôs payments deviate by >Y% from its 7-day moving average, with no corresponding increase in its input workload, there‚Äôs Z% chance of error‚Äù). These insights can then translate into better rules or alerts. Machine learning models could even personalize their strategies to each user‚Äôs risk tolerance: one user might prefer the AI be very tightly watched (risk-averse), another might accept more risk for smoother operation. The models could adjust thresholds accordingly if instructed (similar to how some credit card fraud systems let you set travel notifications or turn off certain protections if you want fewer declines).\nRegTech and Compliance AI: Beyond just fraud, AI can help ensure regulatory compliance dynamically. For example, AI could screen agent payments against sanction lists in real-time (many banks already use AI for transaction monitoring). If an agent tries to pay an entity that‚Äôs newly added to a blacklist, AI can catch that instantly. AI can also check if an agent‚Äôs pattern of payments might be structuring (breaking payments into small pieces to avoid reporting thresholds) ‚Äì perhaps not intentional by the agent, but could resemble money laundering behavior. By catching such patterns, the system can stop an agent from unintentionally causing a compliance issue for the user. This is especially relevant for enterprise agents handling large flows of money ‚Äì the company must remain compliant with AML laws even if an AI is initiating the wires. Machine learning models trained on typologies of illicit finance could monitor agent transactions just as they do human ones.\n\nIn summary, while on one hand we‚Äôre tasking AI agents to spend money, on the other hand we‚Äôre deploying AI to oversee that spending. This creates an interesting layered AI system ‚Äì one doing the work, another (or several) watching the work. The goal is a self-reinforcing safety net: as agents get smarter and potentially more complex, so do the systems that guard them. Machine learning is essential to adapt to the new patterns that will emerge with autonomous payments, because hard-coding all scenarios is impossible. By continuously learning, AI-driven governance systems can handle novel situations and evolve rules that humans might not have conceived upfront. Early examples in industry already emphasize profiling agent behavior and doing real-time risk assessment, which are classic ML-driven tasks. It‚Äôs likely that as agent payments scale, every major payment platform will incorporate an AI-based fraud engine tuned for agents, and every enterprise will have AI-enhanced monitoring for their autonomous processes. This ‚ÄúAI for AI governance‚Äù ensures that increased autonomy doesn‚Äôt mean increased chaos ‚Äì instead, it can actually lead to more control and security than legacy systems, because well-designed AI can react faster and more precisely than humans in managing transaction risk.\n\nConceptual Models for Agent-Based Payment Flows\n\nAutonomous agent payments can be orchestrated in various structural ways depending on the use case. These conceptual models describe how an agent might be authorized to spend and how those spending processes are organized. They aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive ‚Äì an agent platform might employ several of these models in combination.\n\nPay-Per-Task (Microtransaction Model): In this model, an agent pays for each task or service usage as needed, effectively handling microtransactions or per-action payments. Think of an agent that has to use a third-party API that charges $0.01 per request ‚Äì instead of the user pre-paying a large amount, the agent could pay those cents on the fly as it calls the API. This model is especially relevant in a future scenario of agent marketplaces: one agent might rent the service of another agent or an API just for one task and pay instantly for that single task. It‚Äôs akin to a human buying a single song or single article rather than a subscription. The advent of cryptocurrencies and fast payment systems is what makes pay-per-task viable, because the friction and cost of very small payments is being reduced. If each task can be monetized and settled immediately, agents could offer ‚Äúhyper-specific, on-demand services at scale,‚Äù enabling new business models like pay-per-task or pay-per-insight. For example, an AI writing assistant agent might sell a one-time essay edit to a user‚Äôs agent for $0.50, which is paid right after the service is delivered. On the spending side, pay-per-task means the user‚Äôs agent must have the capability to continually make small payments: a robust micropayment mechanism (perhaps via a prepaid fund or linked wallet) that doesn‚Äôt require separate human approval each time due to volume. This model emphasizes a tight coupling of action and payment ‚Äì great for accountability (you pay exactly for what was done) and budgeting (costs scale linearly with usage). One challenge is ensuring transaction fees or overhead don‚Äôt outweigh the micro amounts; that‚Äôs where specialized systems (layer-2 blockchain solutions, agent-specific payment networks, or aggregated billing after micro-auths) might come in. But conceptually, pay-per-task is likely to flourish in agent-to-agent interactions and in IoT contexts. Imagine a future where your smart car pays a few cents to every traffic light‚Äôs AI for optimal routing information, or your agent pays another agent a nickel to quickly summarize a news article ‚Äì millions of such microtransactions could happen behind the scenes, settled by the second. This model offers maximum granularity of control and cost allocation.\nBudget Envelopes (Allowance Model): This model draws from the classic budgeting strategy of envelope budgeting ‚Äì you allocate certain amounts of money to specific purposes. For agents, this means giving each agent or each category of an agent‚Äôs spending a defined budget bucket. For instance, you might allocate $200/month for your household AI to buy groceries and $50/month for it to buy digital services. The agent is aware of these limits and plans its spending accordingly (much like a person with an allowance). Enterprises could do similar: an AI agent managing marketing has a $10k budget for the quarter. The ‚Äúenvelope‚Äù can be a virtual wallet or sub-account that the agent draws from. This model ensures that even if the agent optimizes within its domain, it won‚Äôt overspend the broader plan. It‚Äôs a straightforward way to enforce financial discipline. The agent can also be designed to self-monitor its budget ‚Äì if halfway through the month it‚Äôs spent too much, it might adjust by deferring less critical purchases. It encourages a form of financial reasoning in the agent: treat the budget as a hard constraint and make the best use of it. Technically, implementing budget envelopes can be done via separate accounts (which is clean but requires moving money in/out) or via internal accounting in the agent if using a single account with checks. Many current implementations essentially use this model by giving agents prepaid wallets ‚Äì that wallet is the envelope, once empty, the agent stops until refilled. Budget envelopes can also be hierarchical: e.g., an agent might have a yearly budget broken into monthly envelopes, and if it saves in one month, it can roll over to the next. Or multiple agents each have envelopes and a higher-level controller (or the user) reallocates between them if needed. This model aligns well with how businesses do departmental budgets or how people handle discretionary spending, so it‚Äôs intuitive to manage. It gives users a clear handle on costs: you know the maximum loss or spend from each agent per period. One must be careful to set the envelope appropriately ‚Äì too small could stifle the agent‚Äôs usefulness, too large and you risk more exposure. But since envelopes are adjustable, one can iterate to find the sweet spot, and possibly use AI (as mentioned earlier) to predict and suggest optimal budgets per envelope.\nEvent-Driven Spending (Trigger-Based Model): Here, the focus is that payments are initiated not on a continuous basis or by request, but in response to specific events or conditions. An agent operating under this model listens for certain triggers and then unlocks funds or executes payments when those triggers occur. This is akin to setting rules: ‚ÄúIf X happens, pay Y.‚Äù We have rudimentary versions of this already (like an automatic stock trade ‚Äúbuy at $price‚Äù or an IFTTT rule ‚Äúif my account drops below $100, transfer $50‚Äù). With AI agents, these triggers can be far more complex and the actions more involved. For instance, consider an IoT maintenance agent: Event: a sensor detects a machine part failure. Trigger: the maintenance agent verifies the issue and automatically places an order for a replacement part, paying for overnight shipping. The payment only happens when the event (part failure) occurs, and is exactly tied to that event‚Äôs resolution. Another example: a personal health AI might have a rule ‚Äúif pharmacy prices for my medication drop below a threshold then buy a 3-month supply.‚Äù The spending is event-driven (price drop event triggers the purchase). This model ensures the agent isn‚Äôt spending arbitrarily; it‚Äôs responding to external needs or opportunities. It is very useful for just-in-time purchasing and can optimize costs or efficiency (like buying only when needed or when favorable). Implementing event-driven spending requires the agent to be integrated with event streams or monitors. The architecture often involves an event bus or message queue where various systems publish events (inventory low, price high, task completed, etc.), and the agent subscribes to relevant ones. When an event hits, the agent‚Äôs logic (or a smart contract) decides if a payment should be made. Smart contracts are actually a natural fit for some of this: you can lock funds in a contract that auto-releases payment when on-chain or oracle-reported events occur (e.g., an insurance payout when a weather oracle reports a hurricane). For agents, not all triggers are so clear-cut, but AI allows recognition of complex events (maybe a pattern of sensor data triggers a maintenance action). Event-driven architecture is seen as key to scaling AI agents, and that extends to payments: by reacting to events, agents can handle financial decisions in a scalable, decoupled way rather than constant human prompts. The challenge is ensuring the triggers are reliable and the agent‚Äôs response is appropriate ‚Äì essentially encoding the business logic for spending decisions. But many domains (like routine restocking, threshold-based actions) are well-suited to this. This model overlaps with pay-per-task sometimes (the event is the task completion that triggers payment), or with budget envelopes (the agent still has an envelope but only spends when events demand).\n\nSubscription / Recurring Model: While not mentioned explicitly in the question, for completeness: an agent might operate under a recurring payment model, where it has authority to pay certain bills or subscriptions on a schedule. This is a subset of event-driven (the event is time passage or billing cycle). For example, an agent managing your subscriptions could automatically pay your monthly Netflix and gym membership. The novelty is the agent could also decide when to cancel or renegotiate these based on your usage (but as long as they are active, it pays them). This is similar to how we use autopay now, but with an AI layer that could optimize ‚Äì e.g., if a subscription price increases unexpectedly, the agent might alert you or decide to cancel if it knows you barely use it. I mention this because a lot of B2C agent use might start here: managing recurring expenses. It‚Äôs low-hanging fruit for automation (already partially automated by merchants, but an agent could consolidate and oversee it in the user‚Äôs interest).\n\nPerformance-Based or Outcome-Based Payments: In some scenarios, an agent might only pay upon successful completion of something (this shades into smart contracts and multi-party workflows). For example, an agent hires a freelance AI (say, an image generator for a project) and escrows the payment, releasing it only when the image meets certain criteria. This is like a mini contract enforcement: the payment is contingent on an outcome. Agents could handle this by evaluating the outcome themselves (AI judge) or by predefined checks. It‚Äôs a more complex model but aligns with how businesses want to pay for results, not efforts.\n\nBringing it together, these conceptual models aren‚Äôt exclusive. A comprehensive agent system might allocate budgets (envelopes), allow pay-per-task within those budgets, and have certain event-driven triggers for larger actions, all while using AI to adjust things dynamically. For example: you give your home AI a monthly budget (envelope). Within that, it has freedom to pay-per-task for routine things (buy groceries when needed, pay per song it plays from a music service, etc.). Additionally, you set an event-driven rule: if an appliance breaks (event), it can spend up to a certain amount to get a replacement part or call a repair service, otherwise it should wait for your approval. This illustrates a multi-model approach.\n\nImportantly, these models mirror common human financial patterns (piecemeal spending, budgets, triggers like bill due dates). By structuring agent payments in familiar ways, it‚Äôs easier to slot them into everyday life and business and easier for users to understand and trust them.\n\nThe pay-per-task model highlights new possibilities unlocked by autonomous systems ‚Äì an economy of microtransactions that wasn‚Äôt feasible at human scale. The budget envelope model emphasizes safety and control by partitioning funds. The event-driven model emphasizes reactivity and efficiency ‚Äì money moves only when needed. In designing agent payment capabilities, thinking in terms of these patterns helps ensure we cover the necessary use cases and constraints.\n\nShort-Term Solutions vs. Long-Term Innovations\n\nThe path to fully autonomous agent payments will likely progress in stages. Short-term solutions will leverage existing technology with minimal changes, allowing us to safely test and gain experience. Long-term innovations may overhaul how payments work or introduce entirely new paradigms as technology and regulations catch up. Here we compare what can be done now (or very soon) versus what we envision in the future:\n\nShort-Term Feasible Solutions:\n\nControlled Delegation via Existing Rails: In the immediate term, the most practical approach is to use existing payment rails (cards, bank transfers, etc.) with an agent-specific twist. This includes issuing virtual cards with low limits for agents, or giving them access to a small prepaid account. These are things we can do today through fintech services. For instance, a user can right now use a service like Privacy.com to create a virtual card with a $20 cap and give that to an AI agent for a specific purchase ‚Äì no new tech needed, just integration effort. Companies like Stripe have already released toolkits to facilitate this kind of controlled delegation to agents. This allows immediate experimentation: agents can start performing real transactions on a small scale, providing value (like automating a $5 purchase) without a big risk. As noted, startups like Skyfire have launched networks where you deposit a limited sum for the agent to use, showing that even with today‚Äôs tech, an agent can be given a little ‚Äúwallet‚Äù and go spend under supervision.\nHuman-in-the-Loop for High-Stakes: In the short run, it makes sense to keep humans involved for anything beyond trivial transactions. The agent can handle initiation and maybe execution of small payments, but for larger ones it should request approval. This hybrid approach is already palatable to businesses: it‚Äôs similar to how RPA bots or scripts might prepare a payment batch but a manager still presses the final ‚Äúsubmit‚Äù button. It mitigates the biggest fear (a mistake draining funds) while still saving time on the prep work. Over time, the threshold for human approval might increase as comfort grows, but initially one could set it low (like any payment over $50 or outside a set list of merchants must be confirmed by a person). This is basically implementing those spending controls and approval chain discussed earlier. It‚Äôs feasible with current tech ‚Äì email or mobile prompts for approval are easy to integrate. This ensures that, in practice, no catastrophic transaction should slip through, because a human eyes anything significant. The agent still adds value by doing everything up to that point automatically. As an example, a short-term deployment might have an AI agent scheduling vendor payments, but the final release of funds happens when a human clicks ‚Äúokay‚Äù on each or on a batch ‚Äì which is not much different from current workflows except the AI prepared it instead of a clerk.\nUse of Custodial Wallet Services: Early implementations might favor custodial models because they fit into regulatory frameworks more neatly. A fintech or bank can offer a service where they hold the funds and simply provide an API to the user‚Äôs agent. This way, the compliance (KYC/AML, etc.) is handled by the service, and the user just has to trust that service. This is something that can be launched without requiring legal reform ‚Äì it‚Äôs basically a fintech product. Indeed, Skyfire‚Äôs approach uses a custodial stablecoin wallet, and exchanges like Coinbase or Binance could theoretically offer sub-accounts for AI agents under a user‚Äôs main account. The benefit in the short term is you don‚Äôt have to reinvent how to secure keys or integrate with banks ‚Äì the service does it. It‚Äôs a bit centralized, but that‚Äôs acceptable initially because it‚Äôs simpler and safer (someone is accountable). Users might be more willing to try if a reputable institution is in charge of the money layer.\nSandboxing and Testing in Limited Domains: In the immediate future, agent payments will likely be rolled out in limited domains to gather data and confidence. For example, a company might let an AI agent handle only cloud service payments, nothing else. Or a consumer might use an AI solely for managing a specific subscription. By sandboxing like this, any issues are contained and easier to troubleshoot. These early trials will inform best practices. Technically, this might mean enabling agent payments with one integration (like a particular API or vendor that‚Äôs known to be safe) before expanding. We already see some domain-specific agent efforts ‚Äì e.g., AutoGPT (an autonomous AI experiment) had community members hacking in ways to let it spend small amounts on things like ordering a pizza or using paid APIs. These are hobbyist examples, but companies will do structured pilots where an agent has limited power and is observed.\nUse of Existing Compliance Exemptions: Short term, we might rely on existing rules like small-transaction exemptions. For instance, anti-fraud measures are often relaxed for very small transactions (under a few dollars) ‚Äì an agent could operate freely under those thresholds initially. Similarly, PSD2‚Äôs SCA has exemptions for low-value transactions or trusted beneficiaries; if an agent‚Äôs payments fall under these, they won‚Äôt trigger extra auth. That‚Äôs a way to work within current regs: design the agent‚Äôs role such that it doesn‚Äôt hit regulatory pain points. Meanwhile, for bigger stuff, just treat it as a normal user action (with OTPs or whatever needed ‚Äì maybe the agent can even prompt the user to do the OTP, effectively still saving the user time by getting everything ready).\nEducational and Governance Frameworks: In the short term, establishing clear internal policies (for companies) or user agreements (for consumers with a service) about agent payments will fill the legal gap informally. E.g., a company might require that ‚Äúall AI agent-initiated payments must be logged and reviewed weekly by finance‚Äù, or a user using an AI payment service might sign an agreement acknowledging they take responsibility for the agent‚Äôs transactions (so the bank is off the hook for disputes). These aren‚Äôt technology per se, but they‚Äôre practical steps to get everyone comfortable enough to try.\nLeverage of Familiar Interfaces: Early agent payment implementations may hide the complexity by using familiar interfaces. For example, an agent might actually just use a virtual browser to complete a web checkout like a human, as a stopgap if no API is available. This is essentially an RPA approach (simulating clicks). It‚Äôs not elegant or long-term, but if it gets the job done now, some will use it. Over time, merchants will hopefully offer APIs, but this approach means agents can start doing tasks today on websites that only have human-facing interfaces. Of course, proper credentials and maybe a ‚Äúbot browser‚Äù headless mode would be needed (and not violating terms of service of sites). This is akin to screen-scraping ‚Äì not ideal, but often a practical bridge.\n\nIn short, short-term solutions use current systems with added layers of control and involve humans and institutions heavily to manage risk. They aim for quick wins (like automating small tasks) without demanding new infrastructure or laws. We‚Äôre already seeing these in action in 2024-2025: limited agent payment networks, API tools from major payment processors, etc., are emerging to test the waters.\n\nLong-Term Innovations:\n\nNative Agent Payment Networks: Looking further out, we might see entirely new payment networks or extensions built from the ground up for autonomous commerce. These networks would treat agents as first-class citizens rather than anomalies. For example, there could be a network where each agent has a digital identity, reputation score, and perhaps stake or bond, and transactions on the network can automatically verify the agent‚Äôs credentials. This could piggyback on blockchain technology or be an evolution of card networks or bank networks. One could imagine Visa or a new consortium creating an ‚ÄúIoT and AI payment network‚Äù optimized for high-frequency, low-value transactions and capable of agent authentication. Alternatively, decentralized networks (like certain blockchain ecosystems) might become the de facto platforms if they handle the scale and speed. The long-term vision mentioned by some innovators is millions of agents transacting in real-time globally, which might strain today‚Äôs systems but could be achieved with a combination of blockchain scaling and/or new protocols. Long-term, if such networks succeed, agents wouldn‚Äôt need to hack around human systems; they‚Äôd have systems designed for them. This might mean, for instance, real-time gross settlement for all transactions (no 2-day clearing), costs per transaction measured in fractions of a cent, and security models that assume programs are calling the shots. It‚Äôs a big change that could even benefit human payments (making them faster/cheaper) as a side effect.\nAccount Abstraction and Smart Wallet Pervasiveness: On the crypto side, long-term innovations like Ethereum‚Äôs account abstraction (ERC-4337) will mature. This will make smart contract wallets ubiquitous and user-friendly. It could reach a point where a regular user doesn‚Äôt even know they‚Äôre using a blockchain under the hood ‚Äì they just have a ‚Äúsmart wallet‚Äù that seamlessly interacts with both crypto and traditional finance. In such a scenario, giving an agent controlled access to a wallet with custom rules might be as easy as installing an app. The agent could then operate with a high degree of autonomy, and the wallet‚Äôs smart contract ensures safety (limits, multi-sig, etc.). The user could easily set policies through a UI that directly translate into the wallet‚Äôs code (today, this is still a bit technical). In the long run, these advanced wallets might integrate with banks and merchants ‚Äì e.g., a merchant could accept a signed message from a smart wallet as a payment authorization, not caring whether a human or AI initiated it, since the funds are guaranteed by the wallet‚Äôs code. This blurs the line between traditional and crypto payments, likely making many transactions faster and programmable. Additionally, long-term innovations in crypto like layer-2 networks, cross-chain interoperability, and stablecoin adoption will address current issues (like high fees or volatility), making crypto a more stable backbone for agent transactions.\nAI Integration in Financial Services (‚ÄúAutonomous Finance‚Äù): We may see banks and fintechs providing integrated AI agent services. Instead of the user cobbling together an agent and a bank account, the bank might offer ‚ÄúAI treasurer‚Äù or ‚ÄúAI assistant‚Äù as a feature. For instance, your bank‚Äôs app in 2030 might come with an AI that can automatically pay your bills, optimize your savings, dispute charges, etc., essentially an in-house agent. Under the hood, it uses all the internal APIs and data the bank has, so it‚Äôs very effective and secure. Similarly, businesses might get offerings from their banks or ERP vendors for AI-driven cash management or procurement. This is less about a separate agent economy and more about infusing AI into existing finance roles. The result is similar ‚Äì payments happen autonomously ‚Äì but the trust is easier because it‚Äôs your known bank doing it on your behalf with AI. The innovation here is organizational and AI advancement rather than new networks. But it could lead to widespread adoption since people trust their financial institutions (to an extent) and those institutions can navigate regulation for them.\nRegulatory Frameworks and Legal Status: In the long run, lawmakers and regulators will likely establish clearer rules for autonomous agents in commerce. This could include clarifying liability (e.g., legally treating an AI‚Äôs action as an action by the owner, which is mostly the case now, but making it explicit), perhaps even granting some legal status for certain autonomous entities (though that‚Äôs controversial and not assured). We might see requirements for agent auditing, or certifications for AI systems used in critical financial roles (like how algorithms in trading are sometimes certified by exchanges). Conversely, regulations might also adapt to facilitate innovation: for example, raising thresholds for requiring human authentication if it‚Äôs an AI with a good track record, or allowing machine identities to satisfy certain KYC elements for low-risk accounts. The concept of ‚ÄúElectronic agents‚Äù is already recognized in some contract laws (e.g., the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act in the US acknowledges contracts formed by electronic agents), and this body of law will expand. By addressing these in legal terms, long-term we remove the ambiguity that currently makes institutions nervous to allow AI payments. A future where it‚Äôs legally commonplace for ‚ÄúAgent Smith, registered to Company ABC, executed payment of $10,000 and it‚Äôs fully binding‚Äù is possible. Achieving that will likely involve years of proven safe operation and incremental law changes.\nCross-Industry Platforms and Standards: Imagine an ‚ÄúAgentPay Standard‚Äù consortium where banks, tech companies, IoT firms, etc., agree on protocols for how agents identify themselves, communicate payment info, and handle disputes. Long-term innovation isn‚Äôt just technical, but also standardization. If, say, a standard agent identity token or message format existed, any agent could plug into any merchant or bank that supports it, much like how web standards enabled the internet‚Äôs growth. We might get to a point where your agent can ‚Äútalk‚Äù payment with someone else‚Äôs agent as easily as web browsers talk to servers today ‚Äì because of shared protocols. Some early steps in that direction might be projects in W3C or other bodies focusing on decentralized ID (DID) and verifiable credentials; marrying those to payments could yield standardized agent authentication. This seems esoteric, but it‚Äôs what would ultimately make agent payments ubiquitous and low-friction ‚Äì you wouldn‚Äôt need custom integration for each case, it would just be an accepted method.\nFusion of AI and Economics ‚Äì Negotiated Autonomy: Far out, one can imagine agents not just executing payments, but negotiating terms and value among themselves. Economic optimization algorithms could allow agents to price services dynamically and settle on agreements (a simple example: two agents negotiating a fair price for a piece of data one has and the other wants, then executing the payment). This is a layer above just ‚Äúmaking a payment‚Äù ‚Äì it‚Äôs the agents participating in an economy with minimal human input. That requires complex AI (to understand utility, trust, etc.) and robust payment plumbing to support rapid transactions, possibly microtransactions or conditional escrow. It‚Äôs a long-term concept that could give rise to markets of AI services trading with each other. The payment aspect here needs to be invisible, trust-minimized, and instantaneous, likely harnessing smart contracts that hold collateral or enforce deals. While quite futuristic, progress in both AI negotiation and blockchain smart contracts points in this direction. At that stage, the innovation is not just in payments but in economic models ‚Äì we‚Äôd have to ensure these autonomous economies don‚Äôt spiral into unintended outcomes (financial flash crashes caused by AIs, etc., which is another area of needed innovation in safeguards).\n\nIn essence, long-term innovations aim to make agent payments seamless, scalable, and integrated into the fabric of commerce. Short-term, we‚Äôre bolting on to existing systems; long-term, we‚Äôll likely reinvent parts of those systems for a new paradigm. It‚Äôs akin to the early days of the internet (dial-up modems over phone lines) vs. the eventual dedicated broadband infrastructure. We‚Äôre now in the ‚Äúdial-up‚Äù phase for agent payments ‚Äì using what we have. The ‚Äúbroadband‚Äù phase will be purpose-built for autonomous interactions.\n\nOne concrete sign of this trajectory: payments companies that ignore this trend may find themselves outpaced by those that embrace it. Just as e-commerce gave rise to PayPal and Stripe, agentic commerce could produce new winners, or push incumbents to evolve radically. The opportunity space includes building the secure fraud paradigms for agents, as well as the user-friendly platforms for deploying them ‚Äì both are being pursued now in nascent forms and will mature over the coming decade.\n\nTo illustrate the progression and compare key mechanisms discussed (from short-term to long-term usage), the following table provides a comparison of different mechanisms enabling agent payments, summarizing their nature, pros, cons, and use cases:\n\nMechanism\tDescription & Usage\tPros\tCons\tExample Use Cases\nVirtual Credit Cards (VCCs)\tTemporary card numbers issued via API, usable for single or limited online transactions. Can be attached to user accounts and controlled by AI agents.\t\nWidely accepted online\nFine-grained spend control\nIsolates risk and exposure\n\t\nCard-only scope\nAPI security and PCI compliance concerns\nMay require new VCC per transaction\n\t\nShopping bots making single-use purchases\nScoped usage by SaaS agents per vendor\n\nProgrammable Spending Cards\tCards (virtual or physical) created via APIs with dynamic rules ‚Äî limits, merchant locks, expiration, etc. Managed in real-time.\t\nReal-time policy enforcement\nEasy integration into spend control workflows\nUseful for recurring or vendor-specific expenses\n\t\nRequires access to issuing platforms (Stripe, Marqeta, etc.)\nScaling across many agents may be complex\nFraud exposure if credentials are leaked\n\t\nEnterprise AI managing SaaS subscriptions\nConsumer agent with a monthly budgeted card\n\nCustodial Agent Wallets\tThird-party service holds fiat or crypto.

Each has distinct advantages and trade-offs in enabling AI agents to transact on behalf of users.)\n\nConclusion\n\nEmpowering autonomous AI agents to make payments on our behalf could unlock enormous efficiency and new capabilities ‚Äì from personal assistants that handle errands end-to-end, to autonomous supply chain bots optimizing orders in real time, to entirely new markets of AI services trading with each other. The journey to that future, however, must address a mosaic of challenges spanning technology, law, and ethics.\n\nIn the near term, the safest way forward is to anchor AI payment abilities in existing, proven fintech tools. Virtual credit cards, API-based bank accounts, and limited crypto wallets give us controlled environments to let agents start transacting. These tools, combined with strict spend limits, whitelists, and human approval checkpoints, allow us to test autonomous payments in low-risk scenarios. Early implementations, like issuing each agent a small allowance via a virtual card or stablecoin wallet, are already demonstrating that agents can execute purchases while the user stays in control. Such approaches lean on the familiar: the transactions still ride on Visa or banking rails, and the user can monitor and veto as needed. This means early adopters ‚Äì whether an experimental individual or an innovative enterprise ‚Äì can trial AI-driven payments without betting the farm. Short-term, ‚Äútrust but verify‚Äù is the mantra, with verification very much in the hands of users and existing institutions.\n\nAs we gain experience and confidence, the medium to long term will see more native integration and automation. Financial infrastructure itself will evolve to accommodate agentic activity. We can envision card networks and banks introducing formal support for AI clients (perhaps assigning ‚Äúdigital agent‚Äù IDs linked to accounts, and risk models that treat them differently than humans). Regulatory bodies will likely provide guidance or frameworks, for example explicitly permitting certain autonomous transactions or recognizing digitally signed agent instructions as equivalent to a wet ink signature from the owner. On the technology frontier, decentralized finance and smart contracts could mature to a point where much of an agent‚Äôs spending can occur on-chain with guaranteed compliance to rules ‚Äì effectively encoding the user‚Äôs intent in the wallet that the agent uses. Innovations like on-chain identity, multi-party computation, and account abstraction may converge to give us wallets that an agent can use freely but that the user (or organization) can always audit, control, and if necessary, pull the plug on.\n\nCritically, the human element of trust and transparency must scale alongside the tech. Users will need to see that agents consistently act in their interest and within bounds before handing over larger budgets or mission-critical payments. Each successful test ‚Äì an agent that reliably pays the monthly bills, or a corporate bot that optimizes some purchases and never errs ‚Äì will build trust in the concept. The UIs and tools around agent payments (dashboards, alerts, kill-switches) will be just as important as the payment mechanisms themselves in fostering this trust. In time, managing one‚Äôs fleet of AI agents and their budgets may become as routine as managing subscriptions or employees. Organizations will establish ‚ÄúAgent Finance Policies‚Äù much like today‚Äôs IT policies, and individuals might use personal finance dashboards that include their AI‚Äôs spending alongside their own.\n\nThe opportunities on the horizon are exciting. Imagine a world where you can assign an AI agent a task like ‚Äúkeep my house stocked with groceries and supplies‚Äù and simply allocate it a budget ‚Äì it handles comparing prices, placing orders, making payments, even applying coupons or switching stores to save money, all transparently recorded. In business, entire procurement cycles or financial operations could run autonomously: an AI that not only finds the best vendor but also pays them at just the right time to optimize cash flow and early-pay discounts, or agents that handle gig-work contracts, paying other AI or human freelancers per task seamlessly. New monetization models might emerge: AI developers could sell usage of their AI by the task, with payments streaming in real-time (perhaps per API call paid via an agent wallet). This could lower costs and friction in all kinds of transactions ‚Äì for instance, enabling content or software to be sold in very granular slices (as the Funs Jacobs report noted, agents handling microtransactions could usher in pay-per-insight services at scale).\n\nWith these opportunities, of course, come risks to continuously manage. Fraudsters will undoubtedly attempt to exploit autonomous systems, so constant improvement in AI-driven fraud detection and ‚Äúgood bot‚Äù certification will be needed. There is also the broader ethical dimension: we must ensure autonomy doesn‚Äôt equate to unaccountability. Agent decisions, especially financial ones, should remain aligned with human values and directives. Transparency, auditability, and the ability to override are key to maintaining this alignment. The ecosystem should evolve such that when an AI agent pays for something, it‚Äôs always clear on whose behalf it did so and under what authorization. Only then can legal and social systems adapt comfortably (for example, handling disputes or errors ‚Äì perhaps in the future if an AI agent pays the wrong party, there‚Äôll be standardized processes to resolve that, much like chargebacks today, but those processes need clarity on responsibility).\n\nIn conclusion, enabling AI agents to make payments will be a gradual but transformative process. In the early stage we find ourselves in (circa 2025), the strategy is to start small, build trust, and use plenty of safety nets. Over the next several years, we‚Äôll likely see successful patterns emerge ‚Äì some combination of virtual cards, smart wallets, and oversight mechanisms ‚Äì that prove the concept in various domains. Each success will pave the way for relaxing constraints and expanding the agent‚Äôs financial autonomy. Long-term, a synergy of fintech and AI advancements could lead to a world where autonomous economic agents are as commonplace as online banking is today, operating within a framework of trust, transparency, and user control that has been thoughtfully crafted along the way.\n\nThe evolution of fintech systems (neobanks, card networks, fraud engines) shows they are capable of adapting ‚Äì just as they embraced online and mobile channels, they can embrace AI agents as a new type of client or user. And just as AI is revolutionizing how decisions are made, it will also revolutionize how payments flow ‚Äì making them more intelligent, efficient, and possibly even more secure (with AI monitoring). By marrying the strengths of AI (speed, optimization, pattern recognition) with robust financial safeguards, we can create agent payment systems that are not only convenient, but actually enhance security and compliance compared to purely human processes (for example, an attentive AI might catch an overcharge or fraud attempt that a busy human would miss).\n\nThe coming years will be about tackling the challenges identified ‚Äì refining authentication for non-humans, crafting new fraud paradigms, updating regulations ‚Äì and seizing the opportunities with innovative tools (like programmable cards and crypto protocols). The detailed comparison of mechanisms from VCCs to smart contracts illustrates that we have a rich toolbox; the task now is deploying these tools in the right combinations for each context. A B2B procurement agent might use a completely different setup than a consumer shopping bot, but both can be built on principles of limited delegated authority and incremental trust-building.\n\nUltimately, success will be when autonomous agent payments become ‚Äúboring‚Äù ‚Äì as in, they work so reliably and are so well-governed that users no longer fret about them, much like we trust our electricity or our direct deposit today. Achieving that will take deep collaboration between AI developers, fintech innovators, regulators, and users themselves providing feedback. The trend is clear: we are moving toward greater automation in every aspect of life, and finance is no exception. By learning from early efforts, staying vigilant on safety, and iterating on both technology and policy, we can ensure that autonomous AI agents become trustworthy stewards of our payments.\n\nIn summary, giving AI agents wallets and the power to spend on our behalf is a frontier being actively explored. Early implementations with virtual cards and programmable wallets show promise in balancing autonomy with control. With robust safeguards, the ethical and technical challenges are surmountable. As the ecosystem matures, we can expect a future where autonomous agents transact routinely ‚Äì optimizing business processes, enhancing consumer convenience, and even enabling new economic interactions ‚Äì all underpinned by frameworks that keep these agents accountable, secure, and aligned with their human owners every step of the way.\n\nReferences and Links\nAI agents have brains, but where are their wallets?\nWallet Wars Part 2 - How AI Agents will book your flight\nWhy do AI agents need crypto for payments?)\nRebuilding Trust in the Age of AI\nPayments Has Embraced Artificial Intelligence, But Agentic AI Brings‚Ä¶\nPayment options for AI Agents\nThe Future of AI Agents is Event-Driven) (The Secret to Smarter AI Agents?\nHow Autonomous Should AI Agents Really Be?\nWhat is a Smart Contract Wallet?

    "content": "What paints the Dolomites pink? The magic of the legendary 'enrosadira'\n18 hours ago\nShare\nSave\nAnna Fiorentino\nAlta Badia\n\nIn Italy‚Äôs Dolomites, the ancient coral peaks glow pink at dawn and dusk in a rare natural phenomenon called the enrosadira ‚Äì a magical moment that makes skiing here unforgettable.\n\nMaybe it's skiing beneath prehistoric, snow-capped spires or the combination of homemade pasta and Austrian apple strudel. But the apr√®s-ski scene just hits differently in Italy's Dolomite Mountains ‚Äì and the \"enrosadira\" certainly has something to do with it.¬†\n\nThis rare natural phenomenon washes over the Dolomites at dawn and dusk when the sun's rays reflect off the craggy peaks in steamy shades of hot pink and wildfire red. The revered towers and cliffs illuminate, transporting visitors back to when the ancient Unesco World Heritage-listed mountains were a coral reef ascending from the sea. And soon, these spectacular sunsets will light up for the entire world when the Dolomites co-host the Milano Cortina 2026 Olympics and Paralympics. But for now, you can still catch this wild, blushing beauty without all the crowds.\n\nIt's no surprise that enrosadira translates to \"turning pink\" in the Dolomites' ancient Ladin language (the world's last spoken Latin dialect). Like many Ladin traditions, tales of these mountains have been passed down for centuries. According to local legend, the magenta, amber and violet-tinged-bedrock that arrives every morning and evening is what's left of an elf king's beloved rose garden after his daughter was taken away by a suitor. Broken-hearted, he cast a spell forbidding anyone from seeing the beauty of his magical rose garden in the light of day again ‚Äì only he left out daybreak and twilight.¬†\n\n\"Enrosadira is deeply rooted in our Ladin tradition and linked to legends, emotions and a strong sense of belonging to the land,\" says Nicole Dorigo, a Ladin living in the Dolomites' Alta Badia region in the southern part of the Tyrol valley. \"The play of lights on the mountains creates a magical and evocative atmosphere, conveying a sense of peace and connection with our homeland and the natural beauty that surrounds us.\"\n\nAlta Badia\nThe pink colour that tinges the peaks at dawn or sunset is a result of the Dolomites' ancient coral origins (Credit: Alta Badia)\n\nOf course, the vibrant rock hues can also be explained by science. Back in the 1700s, French geologist Deodat de Dolomieu discovered that the range's peaks aren't pure limestone, as many previously believed. They're made of dolomite ‚Äì a rock formed millions of years ago in a continental collision that uprooted the coral reef and islands between Africa and Europe. Magnesium-rich seawater slowly transformed the limestone reefs into a pale gray and tan sediment that reflects and re-emits more light than regular limestone, explaining why these mountains shine so brightly and vividly.\n\nThe Best of 2025\n\nThe Italian Dolomites was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good.¬†See the full list here.\n\n\"The dolomite layers were all covered by the sea in ancient times. All the sediment from the fish and mud became concrete when the water flooded around it, forming many unique rock shapes,\" says Andrea Milani, a climbing and ski guide for Dolomite Mountains tours. \"In the morning and evening when the sun goes down, with a clear sky, the mountains turn pink.\"\n\nToday these ancient sea beds have become one of the world's premier ski regions, offering 12 interconnected Dolomiti Superski resorts. So, after a day on the slopes, over long, deep snowy peaks and valleys where tectonic plates once collided, pull up a lawn chair and watch the sun rays reflect an intense mauve and deep orange. For the best show, face west at sunset or east at sunrise under a clear sky. The lower the sun sits on the horizon, the more dramatic the colours.\n\nApres-ski doesn't get better than Aperol spritz under enrosadira in crisp mountain air ‚Äì unless you're lucky enough to find a fossilised seashell in the snow. Here are some of the best apr√®s-ski spots to watch the Dolomites blush pink:\n\nAlamy\nDolomite rock reflects and re-emits more light than regular limestone, resulting in the vibrant rock hues (Credit: Alamy)\nCyprianerhof Dolomit Resort, Tires Valley¬†\n\nSip an ap√©ritif on the terrace of this luxury South Tyrolean hotel overlooking the famous Catinaccio (also called Rosengarten) mountains ‚Äì the mythical setting of Ladin king Laurin's rose garden. In real life, these mountains frame Alpine meadows with a 17th-Century chapel, an old watermill and nature park. After your apr√®s-ski sunset experience, dine at the resort's restaurant on fresh, regionally inspired fare.\n\nDelights On Ice, Badia¬†\n\nOn a candlelit Lake Sompunt, nestled between the towering mastiffs, lies Delights On Ice where tuxedoed servers on figure skates bring you Champagne, wowing you with waltz jumps, sizzles and glides as this small frozen pond reflects the rose-colored peaks at sunset. As sommeliers pour Teroldego and other South Tyrolean wines, local chefs dazzle with traditional Italian, German, Austrian and Ladin dishes like homemade silky polenta and spicy goulash.

By the middle of the 1990s, a new paradigm for work had emerged around the modern, boring office suite. That paradigm remained pretty stable until March of 2020.\n\nCOVID is actually useful exception to prove the rule of that stability. Going remote was possible because of the software revolution. Much of our work had consolidated into a single computing device that could be sent home. When things went remote, people essentially looked for 1:1 digital surrogates for most work. The nature of the work itself did not fundamentally change in spite of that massive upheaval.\n\nPretty much anyone who has worked with generative AI thinks we are on the precipice of a paradigm shift in how we work. A new paradigm is incredibly difficult to imagine, harder to describe. We experienced a paradigm shift more recently, but not so much in how we work. Instead, social media brought a shift in how technology mediates the world to us. As I wrote previously, I think we are caught fighting the last war if we think of the present transformation as a continuation of that paradigm shift.\n\nAI will further transform how the world is mediated to us, of course. Still, I think the impact on work will be more profound. Also, general office work has been more resilient to major changes over time than media, which has changed pretty regularly over the past century.\n\nIf we want to think strategically right now, we should be thinking about the last time work really changed. We should be talking about revolutionary and fundamentally boring technologies like word processing.\n\nTyping a document has become perhaps the most intuitive thing we could imagine doing with a computer. This video from 1975, however, demonstrates that that task was neither easy to imagine nor to describe, not even for people who typed documents all day, every day.\n\nTo me, this video seems entirely alien and eerily familiar. It feels a little too on the nose, almost like Saturday Night Live decided to lampoon the way we talk about AI right now by creating a period sketch in which people talked breathlessly and nonsensically about a revolutionary new technology we now regard as mundane.\n\nBy the way, a sketch comedy show did do that. Back in the early days of office computing a Norwegian television program lampooned hapless users of computers and the IT professionals who staffed the help desk, imagining the chaos brought on by the new technology of the book.\n\nBut the video above is not a joke from the present, it is a real window into the past. This video provides a candid account of the gendered assumptions people made about work in 1975. The way work was gendered in that period really mattered and it matters how we gender work today, even if we are much less explicit about it.\n\nRemember that when computers as computers began crunching numbers decades before this, they had replaced ‚Äúhuman computers,‚Äù a gendered job performed almost exclusively by women on behalf of the mostly male engineers. When computers came to the office, they augmented or automated women‚Äôs work, so women learned to operate them.\n\nThe intersection between gendered work and technology deserves far more attention than I can give it here, so I will have to return to this in the future. But, if we are thinking about applying computing to specific kinds of office work, it really matters that men and women in that period did very different kinds of work. It matters that men and women understood different workflows, but also the same workflows from different angles. It matters just as much that women‚Äôs time and labor was generally valued less in every sense.\n\nFor the moment, can we appreciate the overly technical word salad offered here as a plain definition of word processing? ‚ÄúWord processing,‚Äù the narrator explains, ‚Äúis a way to transform ideas into written communication, quickly and accurately, through the use of automated equipment operated by skilled people using revised office procedures.‚Äù Oof.\n\nThe word processing software described in this video is not what we now use. This software was more like a benign application of a key logger placed in an electronic typewriter, slowly piecing together an invisible, final record of keystrokes that could eventually be printed. There, I struggled to define it. It really is difficult. Or, as the narrator says, ‚Äúspooky.‚Äù If you are really curious, many of these text editors are still accessible via the command line on your computer. Go try them out and experience the joy of trying to exit vim.\n\nI am still working on this idea, but it strikes me how much more work became self-service and, therefore, individualistic in our familiar paradigm compared to what existed previously. A different advertisement for the AXXA 90 system‚Äîabout which I can find almost nothing‚Äîanticipates a lot of the language we use for AI, but it also drives home the newness of something we now take for granted: We expect to be able to look up any information we need, whenever we want it, on our own.\n\nThis is remarkable because it shows executives using computers to take on work that had previously been delegated. I am curious what readers think about this, especially if anyone actually experienced this earlier era, which significantly predates me.\n\nIf we struggle to understand these videos, it is because we will not necessarily understand the assumptions they made about work in that moment, about how tasks fit together and how they might come apart when a computer could do some‚Äîbut not all‚Äîof the parts of what had always seemed like a single task. It is easy for us to understand how powerful shared electronic calendars or electronic documents are; it is much more difficult to understand how people worked without them, the assumptions they made that we have forgotten that made all of this a little ‚Äúspooky.‚Äù\n\nPerhaps we should be a little nicer to ourselves as we squint into the future, hyping future applications of technologies we barely understand. It is hard to imagine a paradigm shift simply because it is.\n\nSubscribe to Synthetic Reasoning\nBy Travis Ross ¬∑ Launched 9 months ago\nStrategic thinking for a human-centered future in the age of automated intelligence.

    "title": "The Remarkable Way We Gain Insights",
    "content": "Creativity|Reading Time: 7 minutes\nThe Remarkable Way We Gain Insights\n\nIn 1936 Graham Wallas, co-founder of the London School of Economics, published The Art of Thought, outlining the four stages of the creative process. This pre-dates, by at least a decade, James Webb‚Äôs A Technique for Producing Ideas.\n\nWallas‚Äôs model ‚Äúis still the most common explanation of how insight works. If you do any exploration into the field of insight, you can‚Äôt go far without bumping into Wallas, who is the epitome of a British freethinking intellectual,‚Äù writes Gary Klein in Seeing What Others Don‚Äôt: The Remarkable Ways We Gain Insights.\n\nThe Creativity Question, published in 1976, preserves Wallas‚Äôs ‚ÄúStages of Control‚Äù and presents his model of insight: (1) preparation; (2) incubation; (3) illumination; and (4) verification.\n\nIn Seeing What Others Don‚Äôt: The Remarkable Ways We Gain Insights, Klein summarizes:\n\nDuring the preparation stage we investigate a problem, applying ourselves to an analysis that is hard, conscious, systematic, but fruitless.\n\nThen we shift to the incubation stage, in which we stop consciously thinking about the problem and let our unconscious mind take over. Wallas quoted the German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz, who in 1891 at the end of his career offered some reflections on how this incubation stage feels. After working hard on a project, Helmholtz explained that ‚Äúhappy ideas come unexpectedly without effort, like an inspiration. So far as I am concerned, they have never come to me when my mind was fatigued, or when I was at my working table. They came particularly readily during the slow ascent of wooded hills on a sunny day.‚Äù\n\nWallas advised his readers to take this incubation stage seriously. We should seek out mental relaxation and stop thinking about the problem. We should avoid anything that might interfere with the free working of the unconscious mind, such as reading serious materials.\n\n‚Ä¶\n\nNext comes the illumination stage, when insight bursts forth with conciseness, suddenness, and immediate certainty. Wallas believed that the insight, the ‚Äúhappy idea,‚Äù was the culmination of a train of unconscious associations. These associations had to mature outside of conscious scrutiny until they were ready to surface. Wallas claimed that people could sometimes sense that an insight was brewing in their minds. The insight starts to make its appearance in fringe consciousness, giving people an intimation that the flash of illumination is nearby. At this point the insight might drift away and not evolve into consciousness. Or it might get interrupted by an intrusion that causes it to miscarry. That‚Äôs why if people feel this intimation arising while reading, they often stop and gaze out into space, waiting for the insight to appear. Wallas warned of the danger of trying to put the insight into words too quickly, before it was fully formed.\n\nFinally, during the verification stage we test whether the idea is valid. If the insight is about a topic such as mathematics, we may need to consciously work out the details during this final stage.\n\nWallas noted that none of these stages exist in isolation.\n\nIn the daily stream of thought these four different stages constantly overlap each other as we explore different problems. An economist reading a Blue Book, a physiologist watching an experiment, or a business man going through his morning‚Äôs letters, may at the same time be ‚Äúincubating‚Äù on a problem which he proposed to himself a few days ago, be accumulating knowledge in ‚Äúpreparation‚Äù for a second problem, and be ‚Äúverifying‚Äù his conclusions on a third problem. Even in exploring the same problem, the mind may be unconsciously incubating on one aspect of it, while it is consciously employed in preparing for or verifying another aspect. And it must always be remembered that much very important thinking, done for instance by a poet exploring his own memories, or by a man trying to see clearly his emotional relation to his country or his party, resembles musical composition in that the stages leading to success are not very easily fitted into a ‚Äúproblem and solution‚Äù scheme. Yet, even when success in thought means the creation of something felt to be beautiful and true rather than the solution of a prescribed problem, the four stages of Preparation, Incubation, Illumination, and the Verification of the final result can generally be distinguished from each other. (The Creativity Question)\n\nIf you talk to anyone about insight today, most people are familiar with the model Wallas proposed.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very satisfying explanation that has a ring of plausibility,‚Äù writes Klein, ‚Äúuntil we examine it more closely.‚Äù\n\nKlein points to many counterexamples where people had insights that came unexpectedly, without a preparation stage. A lot of people aren‚Äôt wrestling with a problem when they come up with an accidental insight.\n\nAccording to Wallas, when we‚Äôre stuck and need to find an insight that will get us past an impasse, we should start with deliberate preparation. ‚Ä¶ One flaw in Wallas‚Äôs method is that his sample of cases was skewed. He only studied success stories. He didn‚Äôt consider all the cases in which people prepared very hard but got nowhere.(Seeing What Others Don‚Äôt: The Remarkable Ways We Gain Insights)\n\nSpecific preparation doesn‚Äôt always lead to insights. And the people who gain insights may or may not follow the Wallas model, so perhaps it is incomplete.\n\nWe need another theory.\n\nDiscontinuous Discoveries\n\nSometimes shifts in thinking are not about making minor adjustments or adding details. Sometimes we fundamentally shift core beliefs. This allows us to see the problem in a new way and may lead to insight. We shift from a poor story to a better one. These are discontinuous discoveries.\n\nInsights shift us toward a new story, a new set of beliefs that are more accurate, more comprehensive, and more useful. Our insights transform us in several ways. They change how we understand, act, see, feel, and desire. They change how we understand. They transform our thinking; our new story gives us a different viewpoint. They change how we act. ‚Ä¶ Insights transform how we see; we look for different things in keeping with our new story. (Seeing What Others Don‚Äôt)\n\nIn Wolf Hall, Hilary Mantel makes an important observation, ‚ÄúInsight cannot be taken back. You cannot return to the moment you were in before.‚Äù After insight, everything is different.\n\nInsights are unique is some other ways:\n\nWhen they do appear, they are coherent and unambiguous. They don‚Äôt come as part of a set of possible answers. When we have the insight, we think, ‚ÄúOh yes, that‚Äôs it.‚Äù We feel a sense of closure. This sense of closure produces a feeling of confidence in the insight. (Seeing What Others Don‚Äôt)\n\nThe Difference Between Insight and Intuition\n\nIntuition is the use of patterns they‚Äôve already learned, whereas insight is the discovery of new patterns. (Seeing What Others Don‚Äôt)\n\nThe Role of Stories\n\nStories are a way we frame and organize the details of a situation. There are other types of frames besides stories, such as maps and even organizational wiring diagrams that show where people stand in a hierarchy. ‚Ä¶ These kinds of stories organize all kinds of details about a situation and depend on a few core beliefs we can call ‚Äúanchors,‚Äù because they are fairly stable and anchor the way we interpret the other details. (Seeing What Others Don‚Äôt)\n\nAnd anchors can change. They change when we get new information. They change when we shift our beliefs.\n\nWhat causes us to change our story? Klein proposes five strategies connections, coincidences, curiosities, contradictions, and creative desperation.\n\nIn all of these cases we change our story.\n\nWhen faced with creative desperation, we try to find a weak belief that is trapping us. We want to jettison this belief so that we can escape from fixation and from impasse. In contrast, when using a contradiction strategy, we center on the weak belief. We take it seriously instead of explaining it away or trying to jettison it. We use it to rebuild our story. (Seeing What Others Don‚Äôt)\n\nWhen we‚Äôre desperate, we‚Äôre more likely to attack a weak anchor and give something a try.\n\nIn times of desperation, we actively search for an assumption we can reverse. We don‚Äôt seek to imagine the implications if the assumption was valid. Rather, we try to improve the situation by eliminating the assumption. (Seeing What Others Don‚Äôt)\n\nBut changing our story is not the only way to gain insight. We can also add new anchors.\n\nThe Triple Path\n\nIn the end, Klein came up with the tripe path model of insight, which tries to capture the similarities between the strategies.\n\nSource: Seeing What Others Don‚Äôt: The Remarkable Ways We Gain Insights\n\nThe connection path is different from the desperation path or the contradiction path. We‚Äôre not attacking or building on weak anchors. When we make connections or notice coincidences or curiosities, we add a new anchor to our beliefs and then work out the implications. Usually the new anchor comes from a new piece of information we receive.\n\n‚Ä¶\n\nI‚Äôve combined the connections, coincidences, and curiosities in the Triple Path Model. They have the same dynamic: to build on a new potential anchor. They have the same trigger: our thinking is stimulated when we notice the new anchor. Coincidences and curiosities aren‚Äôt insights in themselves; they start us on the path to identifying a new anchor that we connect to the other beliefs we hold. Connections, coincidences, and curiosities have the same activity: to combine the new anchor with others. This path to insight doesn‚Äôt force us to abandon other anchors. It lets us build a new story that shifts our understanding. This path has a different motivation, a different trigger, and a different activity from the contradiction and the creative desperation paths. Nevertheless, like the other two paths, the outcome is the same: an unexpected shift in the story.\n\nEach of the three paths, the contradiction path, the connection path, and the creative desperation path, gets sparked in a different way. And each operates in a different fashion: to embrace an anomaly that seems like a weak anchor in a frame, to overturn that weak anchor, or to add a new anchor. Future work on insight is likely to uncover other paths to insight besides the three shown in the diagram. (Seeing What Others Don‚Äôt)\n\nOther people weren‚Äôt wrong, they were just following one path.\n\nThe Triple Path Model shows why earlier accounts aren‚Äôt wrong as much as they are incomplete. They restrict themselves to a single path. Researchers and theorists such as Wallas who describe insight as escaping from fixation and impasses are referring to the creative desperation path. Researchers who emphasize seeing associations and combinations of ideas are referring to the connection path. Researchers who describe insight as reformulating the problem or restructuring how people think have gravitated to the contradiction path. None of them are wrong. The Triple Path Model of insight illustrates why people seem to be talking past each other. It‚Äôs because they‚Äôre on different paths.

    "content": "STATE\n'Chemtrails,' cloud seeding would be banned under bill passed by Florida Senate\n'This is about protecting Florida's environment and public health,' the bill's sponsor said.\nAna GonÃÉi-Lessan\nUSA TODAY NETWORK - Florida\nAI-assisted summary\nThe Florida Senate passed a bill that would make it illegal to release chemicals or substances into the atmosphere to manipulate weather, a practice known as geoengineering.\nThe bill's sponsor, Senator Ileana Garcia, claims it aims to address public concerns about aerial spraying despite no evidence of harmful activity.\nThe bill would establish a hotline for residents to report suspicious aerial activity and impose felony charges for violations.\n\nA bill endorsed by Gov. Ron DeSantis that would, among other things, outlaw \"chemtrails\" in Florida has passed in the state's Senate.\n\n\"I have a problem with people spraying perfume around me sometimes, don't you have a problem with people spraying things into the atmosphere that really have no type of empirical data, that you just don't know who they are or what they're doing?\" said Sen. Ileana Garcia, R-Coral Gables, the bill's sponsor, on Thursday morning.\n\n\"Geoengineering and Weather Modification Activities\" (SB 56), prohibits the injection, release, or dispersion of a chemical, a chemical compound, a substance or an apparatus into the atmosphere in Florida to affect the temperature, weather, climate or intensity of sunlight. It was OK'd 28‚Äì9.\n\nAs previously reported, Garcia's bill has been the subject of controversy. Specifically, it would prohibit cloud seeding, the process of releasing tiny particles into the air to increase precipitation, a practice used in arid parts of the Southwestern United States like Utah¬†to increase the water supply. Similar bills have been filed in eight other states, according to the bill analyses.\n\nBut some believe cloud seeding, contrails and the conspiracy theory of \"chemtrails\" are all intertwined. (The term contrail is a portmanteau of \"condensation\" and \"trail\"; chemtrail is \"chemical\" and \"trail.\")\n\nBoth DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier have expressed support for the legislation on social media, with Uthmeier saying his \"office will also be looking at other legal avenues in this area to protect Floridians from the left‚Äôs climate agenda.\"\n\nDeSantis, however, made clear he supports only Garcia's version, criticizing the language of the House bill. \"We don‚Äôt want to indulge this nonsense in Florida, where we are proud of our sunshine,\" he posted.\n\nContrails are the line-shaped clouds visible behind aircraft engines under certain atmospheric conditions. They happen when hot, humid air from the engines condenses into ice crystals in the cold air, the¬†National Weather Service¬†says.\n\nWhile they often fade quickly, especially in dry weather, their appearance and durability can change depending on the conditions the plane flew through, including altitude, temperature, humidity, sunlight, wind speed, and so forth.\n\nContrails have nothing to do with weather modification activities.\n\nGarcia has said conspiracy theories about weather modification were not behind her filing of the bill. \"The bill was drafted to address concerns and raise awareness surrounding these issues. On the contrary, let‚Äôs debunk them,\" she wrote in a post on X in December.\n\nOn Thursday in floor debate, however, Garcia said, while discussing the disinformation that has tagged along with this bill: \"There are condensation trails, and then there are chemtrails that have yet to be established and understood.\"\n\nShe also reassured senators who were wary of the bill that it would not ban legitimate climate research, only \"unregulated weather modification and geoengineering experiments that lack transparency and oversight.\"\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the¬†National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and state weather agencies will continue their work in climate monitoring and forecasting without interruption. She argued that the bill would close a \"loophole\" and start a conversation so that it can be addressed at the federal level.\n\n\"It's up to the feds to step in and begin to look at a lot of these military contracts that are currently being used, and that a lot of the pilots and a lot of constituents from several areas of Florida have honed in on, called in and complained,\" Garcia said.\n\nThe bill would also establish a hotline with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection so residents concerned with streaks in the sky can call and report them.\n\nThe bill, if signed into law, would allow the state to charge a person with a third-degree felony if found participating in weather modification activities, punishable by a term of imprisonment no longer than five years and and a $100,000 fine.\n\n\"This is about protecting Florida's environment and public health,\" Garcia said. \"With no federal guidelines in place, Florida must take responsibility for its own airspace.\"\n\nAna GonÃÉi-Lessan, state watchdog reporter for the USA TODAY Network ‚Äì Florida, can be reached at¬†agonilessan@gannett.com.¬†",

Phil Murphy delivers his State of the State address to a joint session of the Legislature at the statehouse, in Trenton, N.J., Jan. 9, 2024. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)\n\nNEWARK, N.J. (AP) ‚Äî Creating and sharing deceptive media made with artificial intelligence is now a crime in New Jersey and open to lawsuits under a new state law.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed legislation Wednesday making the creation and dissemination of so-called deceptive deepfake media a crime punishable by up to five years in prison, and establishing a basis for lawsuits against perpetrators.\n\nNew Jersey joins a growing list of states enacting measures taking aim at media created using generative AI. At least 20 states have passed similar legislation that targets such media involving elections.\n\nAs of last year, governors in more than a dozen states had signed laws cracking down on digitally created or altered child sexual abuse imagery, according to a review by The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.\n\nNew Jersey‚Äôs law stems in part from the story of Westfield High School student Francesca Mani, who stood alongside the governor as he signed the bill this week. Mani said she became the victim of a deepfake video two years ago and was told that the only punishment for the person who created it was a short suspension because there were no laws against such media.\n\n‚ÄúDoing nothing is no longer an option,‚Äù said Mani, who pushed for the legislation and was recognized by Time last year as an anti-deepfake activist.\n\nThe measure defines a deepfake as any video or audio recording or image that appears to a reasonable person to realistically depict someone doing something they did not actually do.\n\nIn addition to prison time upon conviction, the law establishes civil penalties that would permit victims to pursue lawsuits.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Fortnite introduced Dill Bits as an in-game currency in February as a jest toward crypto. However, these can only be used to buy in-game items.&nbsp;At the time, the announcement of the in-game currency prompted an anonymous crypto user to create their own version of the token on Solana. The recent spike is nowhere near previous surges, however. When the memecoin first launched in February, it surged 4,500% in price to reach a market cap of $4.8 million.

    "content": "An oversold market and reactions to U.S. tariffs may be a thing of the past with traders now eying new economic data and rate cuts in the coming months ‚Äî with expectations of a bitcoin bounce in the near term.Crypto markets saw high volatility on Wednesday and Thursday in the run-up to the tariff announcement, where President Donald Trump levied a minimum 10% fee on all imports to the country.Major tokens bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), Solana‚Äôs SOL, XRP (XRP), and others, zoomed ahead of the speech and slumped as global markets fell, reversing all gains from the start of the week.Markets have since shown an uptick in prices on Friday morning, with BTC steady above $83,100, ETH retaking $1,800 and XRP, SOL and ADA rising over 2%.Ahead of Trump‚Äôs speech, investors transferred larger volumes of Bitcoin, ETH, and XRP into exchanges, suggesting a growing intent to sell, per a CryptoQuant note shared with CoinDesk on Thursday. Bitcoin transactions surged to as much as 2,500 BTC in a single block just hours after Trump began speaking.In the U.S., Coinbase also saw a rise in bitcoin deposits, particularly from large holders.Similarly, ETH inflows into exchanges spiked to an hourly peak of approximately 80,000 ETH. XRP transfers into Binance jumped to 130 million in one hour, up from under 10 million XRP per hour throughout most of the previous day.These rising exchange inflows reflected investor willingness to exit positions amid growing economic uncertainty, CryptoQuant said, with demand for Bitcoin and ETH declining in the perpetual futures market as traders closed their long positions to take profits.But with headwinds behind and a new economic data set to be released later Friday could provide the impetus for a short-term relief in markets.Attention is on the non-farm payroll report scheduled for a Friday release. The monthly U.S. economic indicator released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the change in employment, reflecting job creation, unemployment trends, and wage growth, offering insight into economic health.‚ÄúInvestors are bracing for signs of softness in the U.S. labour market,‚Äù Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast earlier Friday. ‚Äú A weaker-than-expected print would bolster the case for further Fed rate cuts this year, as policymakers attempt to cushion a decelerating economy.‚ÄùData shows markets are pricing in four rate cuts in 2025 ‚Äî 0.25 bps each in June, July, September and December. Rate cuts occur when a central bank, like the Federal Reserve, lowers interest rates to stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper.Bitcoin, and the broader market, tend to react positively to rate cuts, as lower rates reduce the appeal of traditional investments like bonds, driving investors toward alternatives like BTC. Additionally, a weaker dollar can enhance BTC‚Äôs value as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation.QCP Capital said it continues to observe elevated volatility in the short term, with more buyers of downside protection.‚ÄúThat said, with positioning now light and risk assets largely oversold, the stage may be set for a near-term bounce,‚Äù the fund said.",

During this time, the quarterly average of daily active addresses jumped by 490% and XRP price hit a 7-year high.XRP&rsquo;s 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewFast forward to the present, and data shows that the speculative interest surrounding XRP is declining. Holders are increasingly facing losses rather than gains, which is dampening their risk appetite. &ldquo;Retail confidence in XRP may be slipping&rdquo;Since bottoming in 2022, Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP have gained 500% to 600%, but the bulk of XRP&rsquo;s gains came from a parabolic price increase. Data from Glassnode shows that XRP daily active addresses jumped by 490%, whereas the same metric for Bitcoin increased by 10% over the past four months. XRP's new investor realized the cap. Source: GlassnodeThis retail-driven surge pushed XRP&rsquo;s realized cap from $30.1 billion to $64.2 billion, with $30 billion of that inflow coming from investors in the last six months. The share of XRP&rsquo;s realized cap held by new investors (less than six months) jumped from 23% to 62.8%, signaling a rapid wealth shift. However, since late February 2025, capital inflows have dipped significantly. XRP realized profit/loss ratio. Source: GlassnodeThe primary reason is that investors are currently locking in fewer profits and staring at higher losses. This can be identified by the realized loss/profit ratio, which has constantly declined since 2025. Glassnode analysts said, &ldquo;Given the retail-dominated inflows and largely concentrated wealth in relatively new hands, this alludes to a condition where retail investor confidence in XRP may be slipping, and this may also be extended across the broader market.&rdquo;Besides weakening confidence among newer investors, the distribution of XRP among whale addresses reflects a similar trend. Data shows a steady increase in whale outflows since the start of 2025, suggesting that large holders have been consistently trimming their positions.

    "title": "Trump‚Äôs tariffs will deliver a big blow to climate tech",
    "content": "US president Donald Trump‚Äôs massive, sweeping tariffs sent global stock markets tumbling on Thursday, setting the stage for a worldwide trade war and ratcheting up the dangers of a punishing recession. \n\nExperts fear that the US cleantech sector is especially vulnerable to a deep downturn, which would undermine the nation‚Äôs progress on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and undercut its leadership in an essential, growing industry.\n\n‚ÄúIt would be hard for me to think of cleantech or climate tech sectors that aren‚Äôt facing huge risks,‚Äù says Noah Kaufman, senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, who served on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Joe Biden. \n\n‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre a country without a federal climate strategy at this point, with an economy headed in the wrong direction, so I don‚Äôt see a lot of reason to be optimistic,‚Äù he adds.\n\nHow deep and wide-ranging the impact of the coming economic shifts could be depends on many variables still in play and on reactions still to come. In particular, the negotiations underway in Congress over the budget will determine the fate of subsidies for electric vehicles, battery production, and other clean technologies. Many of those programs were established by former president Biden‚Äôs signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBut there are mounting challenges and rising risks across the cleantech and climate tech sectors. Notably any slowdown in the broader economy threatens to tighten corporate and venture capital funding for startups working on carbon removal, synthetic aviation fuels, electric delivery vehicles, and other technologies that help companies meet climate action goals.¬†\n\nIn addition, Trump‚Äôs tariffs, particularly the now 54% levy on Chinese goods, will push up the costs of key components for many businesses. Notably, the US imported $4 billion worth of lithium-ion batteries from China during the first four months of last year, so the tariff increase would impose a huge tax on products that go into electric vehicles, laptops, phones, and many other devices. \n\nHigher prices for aluminum, steel, copper, cement, and numerous other goods and materials will also drive up the costs of doing all sorts of business, including building wind turbines, solar farms, and geothermal plants. And if China, Canada, the European Union, and other nations respond with retaliatory trade measures, as is widely expected, it will also become harder or more expensive for US companies to export goods like EVs or battery components to overseas markets. \n\nEven traditional energy stocks took a beating on Wall Street Thursday, out of fear that any broader economic sluggishness will drive down electricity demand.\n\nTrump administration cuts to the Department of Energy and other federal programs could also take away money from demonstration projects that help cleantech companies test and scale up their technologies. And if Congress does eliminate certain subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act, it could halt billion-dollar projects that are being planned or perhaps even some that are already under construction.\n\nThe growing policy uncertainty and weakening economic conditions alone may already be causing some of this to occur.\n\nSince Trump took office, companies have canceled, delayed, or scaled back at least nine US ‚Äúclean energy supply chain‚Äù developments or operations, according to the Big Green Machine, a database maintained by Jay Turner, a professor of environmental studies at Wellesley College, and student researchers there. The projects that have been affected represent some $8 billion in public and private investments, and more than 9,000 jobs.\n\nThey include KORE Power‚Äôs planned battery facility in Arizona, which the company halted; Envision Automotive Energy Supply‚Äôs paused expansion in Florence County, South Carolina; and Akasol‚Äôs closure of two plants in Michigan. \n\nVW also scaled back production at its recently expanded EV factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, amid slower-than-expected growth in sales and, perhaps, the expectation that the Trump administration will strive to roll back consumer tax credits for vehicle purchases.\n\n‚ÄúThe biggest challenge for companies that are making hundred-million- or billion-dollar capital investments is dealing with the uncertainty,‚Äù Turner says. ‚ÄúUncertainty is a real deterrent to making big bets.‚Äù \n\nVenture capital investments in clean energy have been cooling for a while. They peaked at $24.5 billion in 2022 and settled at around $18 billion annually during the last two years, according to data provided by Pitchbook. First-quarter figures for this year aren‚Äôt yet available, though industry watchers are keen to see where they land. \n\nSome parts of the cleantech sector could hold up better than others through the Trump administration and any upcoming economic gloom. \n\nThe Pitchbook report, for instance, noted that the surge in development of AI data centers is fueling demand for ‚Äúdispatchable energy sources.‚Äù That means the type that can run around the clock, such as nuclear fission, fusion, and geothermal (though in practice, the data center boom has often meant commissioning or relying on natural-gas plants that produce planet-warming emissions).\n\nTrump‚Äôs new energy secretary, Chris Wright, previously the chief executive of the oilfield services company Liberty Energy, has also talked favorably about nuclear power and geothermal‚Äîand rather unfavorably about renewables like solar and wind. \n\nBut observers fear that more sectors will lose than win in any economic downturn to come, and Turner stresses that the decisions made during this administration could last well beyond it.\n\n‚ÄúThe near-term concern is that this emerging clean-energy industry in the US suffers a significant pullback and the US cedes this market to other countries, especially China, that are actively working to position themselves to be leaders in the clean-energy future,‚Äù he says. \n\nThe long-term concern, he adds, is that if government policies on cleantech simply advance and retreat with the whims of each administration, companies will stop trying to make long-term investments that bank on such subsidies, grants or loans. \n\nCatherine Wolfram, a professor of energy and applied economics at MIT, also notes that China and the European Union are forging ahead in developing policies to drive down emissions and build up carbon-free sectors. She observes that they‚Äôre both now moving on to the tougher work of cleaning up heavy industries like steel, while the US is ‚Äúlosing ground on even making clean electricity.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the worst kind of US exceptionalism,‚Äù she says.",

    "title": "How to sell crypto via MetaMask: A beginner‚Äôs guide to cashing out",
    "content": "Key takeawaysNot all tokens can be sold immediately. Airdropped or obscure tokens may lack liquidity or could be scams, so it&rsquo;s important to check before attempting to cash out.Swapping and bridging may be required. To sell, you might need to convert tokens to ETH or stablecoins and bridge them to the Ethereum mainnet.MetaMask integrates fiat off-ramps. You can use the MetaMask Portfolio to sell ETH directly, but be prepared for KYC with third-party providers.Non-KYC and P2P options exist. Platforms like Bisq or LocalCoinSwap allow trading without ID, but they carry more risk and require caution.There are plenty of ways you might end up with a mix of different cryptocurrencies sitting in your MetaMask wallet.Maybe you work in Web3 &mdash; as a developer, copywriter or designer &mdash; and your client paid you in their project&rsquo;s native token.Or maybe you&rsquo;re part of a Bitcoin mining pool and occasionally receive rewards straight to your wallet.You could be farming yield in decentralized finance (DeFi), earning annual percentage yield (APY) on your locked assets. Or, perhaps the most straightforward of all: You completed a few SocialFi tasks and received some community tokens via an airdrop.Whatever the case, you&rsquo;ve got crypto in your MetaMask &mdash; and now you want to turn it into cash.In this guide, you&rsquo;ll learn all the ways you can sell your crypto and withdraw the funds to your bank account or even in cash &mdash; whether you&rsquo;re going through official Know Your Customer (KYC) channels or sticking to more private, non-KYC routes.Things to know before selling tokens on MetaMaskBefore you can turn your tokens into cash, there are a few things you need to get sorted in MetaMask because &ldquo;not all tokens are created equal.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not always as simple as hitting a &ldquo;sell&rdquo; button &mdash; especially if you&rsquo;ve just received tokens via an airdrop or from a lesser-known project.1. Why some airdropped tokens can&rsquo;t be sold (yet)Just because a token shows up in your wallet doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s ready to be sold. In fact, many airdropped tokens aren&rsquo;t listed on exchanges at all. That means there&rsquo;s no market where you can sell them &mdash; not yet, anyway. You might see a price attached to the token, but without buyers or liquidity, that value isn&rsquo;t something you can actually realize right now. So, while it&rsquo;s great to receive free tokens, they may end up sitting idle in your wallet for a while.Did you know? If you see a &ldquo;100% sell fee detected&rdquo; warning on a token, it&rsquo;s likely a scam. Scammers airdrop these tokens, hoping you&rsquo;ll try to sell or interact with them. But when you do, the smart contract takes the full amount &mdash; leaving you with nothing. Worse, some link to fake decentralized applications (DApps) that ask you to &ldquo;claim&rdquo; or &ldquo;unlock&rdquo; the tokens. Connecting your wallet or signing a transaction there can let scammers drain your real assets.2. Adding missing tokens to your walletSometimes, you&rsquo;ll receive tokens that don&rsquo;t even show up in MetaMask at first. That doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re not there &mdash; it just means MetaMask doesn&rsquo;t recognize them by default. You&rsquo;ll need to add them manually by grabbing the token&rsquo;s contract address (usually from the project&rsquo;s official site or Etherscan) and importing it into your wallet. Once you do that, your balance will show up properly.Similarly, if you want to receive any asset other than Ether (ETH), the &ldquo;Import Tokens&rdquo; option lets you manually add these missing tokens so they show up in the assets list.3. Getting ready to swap or bridgeEven if your tokens are visible in MetaMask and technically have value, that doesn&rsquo;t always mean you can sell them for cash right away. Many smaller or newer tokens don&rsquo;t have direct fiat trading pairs &mdash; so you won&rsquo;t be able to exchange them straight into dollars or euros.&nbsp;To get around this, you&rsquo;ll usually need to swap them for something more liquid, like ETH or a stablecoin such as USDC (USDC), which are more commonly supported by fiat off-ramps.In some cases, your tokens might also be sitting on a different blockchain &mdash; like Arbitrum, BNB Chain or Polygon &mdash; while most fiat withdrawal options only support Ethereum mainnet. When that&rsquo;s the case, you&rsquo;ll need to bridge your tokens over to Ethereum before you can sell them.One way to handle both of these steps &mdash; swapping and bridging &mdash; is by using platforms that combine them into a single flow. For example, with Symbiosis.finance, you can swap a token on one chain and receive a more widely accepted token on Ethereum, all in one transaction. This can save you a few steps and reduce the chance of user error when hopping between tools.How to sell crypto with MetaMaskThe simplest way to sell crypto that you hold on MetaMask is by using the application itself. Here&rsquo;s what to do:Open MetaMask portfolio: In your MetaMask extension or app, click the &ldquo;Buy & Sell&rdquo; button. This will take you to the MetaMask Portfolio site, where you can manage all your assets and begin the selling process.Start the sale process: Click on &ldquo;Move crypto&rdquo; at the top of the page and select &ldquo;Sell&rdquo; from the dropdown options.Choose your region and currency: MetaMask will ask for your country of residence and preferred fiat currency. This step ensures you&rsquo;re shown accurate provider options and payout methods available in your area.Enter sale amount: Select Ether and enter how much you&rsquo;d like to convert.Pick a payout option: Next, choose where you want the fiat to go. Depending on your region and provider availability, you might be able to send it to a bank account, PayPal or another method.Compare offers: MetaMask aggregates offers from several third-party providers (like MoonPay, Transak, Sardine, etc.), showing you real-time exchange rates, fees and estimated payout times. Take a moment to compare and pick the best option for you.Complete the sale: Once you&rsquo;ve chosen a provider, MetaMask will guide you through sending the crypto. You&rsquo;ll confirm the transaction in your wallet, and the funds will be transferred to the provider, who handles the fiat payout.There are two things to keep in mind when using the MetaMask application:Firstly, while the application itself might not ask you for KYC, the third-party providers will. So, expect to get your documents ready for this one.Secondly, MetaMask&rsquo;s sell feature only supports ETH on the Ethereum mainnet. This is where the bridging will come in as was explained earlier.Withdrawing crypto via centralized exchangesIf you&rsquo;d rather cash out your crypto through a centralized exchange, Coinbase is a popular option. It&rsquo;s beginner-friendly, offers fiat withdrawals, and supports a wide range of assets. Just note: You&rsquo;ll need to complete KYC verification before withdrawing any fiat.Here&rsquo;s how to do it, step by step:1. Send crypto from MetaMask to Coinbase&nbsp;First things first: You&rsquo;ll need to move your funds from MetaMask to Coinbase.Log in to your Coinbase account and hit &ldquo;Send & Receive&rdquo; at the top.Switch to the &ldquo;Receive&rdquo; tab, pick the crypto you&rsquo;re sending (like ETH or USDC), and copy the wallet address Coinbase gives you.Make sure the network matches &mdash; for example, if you&rsquo;re sending ETH, it should be on the Ethereum (ERC-20) network.Now open MetaMask:Click &ldquo;Send,&rdquo; paste in that Coinbase address, and enter how much you want to transfer.Double-check the network &mdash; if you send it to the wrong one, your funds could disappear.Hit &ldquo;Confirm,&rdquo; and your crypto should show up in Coinbase after a few minutes.2. Sell crypto for fiat on CoinbaseOnce your funds land in Coinbase, it&rsquo;s time to cash out.Head to &ldquo;Buy & Sell&rdquo; at the top and switch to the &ldquo;Sell&rdquo; tab.Choose the crypto you just received and decide how much you want to sell.Pick where you want the money to go &mdash; like your linked bank account, PayPal or your Coinbase balance.Review the details (including any fees), then hit &ldquo;Sell.&rdquo;Did you know? When withdrawing via centralized exchanges, be cautious of minimum withdrawal amounts and any associated fees. Check these details in advance to make sure the limits and costs are acceptable to you before committing to this route.Peer-to-peer with KYCWith peer-to-peer (P2P), you&rsquo;re not selling your crypto to the exchange. Instead, you&rsquo;re selling it to another user. You choose a buyer based on their offer and preferred payment method (like bank transfer, Revolut, Wise, etc.). Once they send the money to your account, you release the crypto to them. The platform holds your crypto in escrow during the process, so no one can just disappear with your funds.With centralized exchanges, you&rsquo;ll have to complete KYC before you&rsquo;re able to trade in this manner.&nbsp;Selling via P2P on BinanceGo to Trade > P2P.Choose the coin you want to sell and browse the list of available buyers.Select a deal, confirm the order, and wait for the buyer to make the payment.Once the payment has arrived in your account, confirm it and release the crypto from escrow.Did you know? Some peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency exchanges offer a &ldquo;cash by mail&rdquo; option, allowing users to send physical cash through postal services or couriers to settle transactions.Cashing out of your MetaMask wallet without KYCFor those looking to convert cryptocurrency from their MetaMask wallet to fiat currency without undergoing Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, there are still a few viable paths.Decentralized P2P platforms let you trade directly with other users, much like their centralized counterparts, though often with minimal or no KYC requirements.&nbsp;LocalCoinSwap: A non-custodial P2P marketplace that supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and payment methods, including cash. It offers escrow protection and emphasizes privacy.Bisq: A fully decentralized exchange that supports a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Monero (XMR). It runs on a peer-to-peer protocol and doesn&rsquo;t require user accounts or KYC.However, without KYC, you&rsquo;re responsible for vetting the person you&rsquo;re trading with. Check their reputation, review any available trade history, and always follow platform safety guidelines.Using cryptocurrency ATMs to withdraw crypto from MetaMaskWithdrawing funds from your MetaMask wallet using cryptocurrency ATMs &mdash; often referred to as Bitcoin ATMs &mdash; is an option that allows you to convert your digital assets into cash. Here&rsquo;s how you can approach this method:Locate a cryptocurrency ATM: Begin by finding a cryptocurrency ATM in your vicinity. Websites like CoinATMRadar provide directories of Bitcoin ATM locations worldwide, detailing the services they offer and the cryptocurrencies they support.Prepare your MetaMask wallet: Ensure that the cryptocurrency you intend to withdraw is supported by the ATM. Bitcoin ATMs predominantly support Bitcoin (BTC), so you may need to use a decentralized exchange (DEX) to swap your current tokens for BTC within your MetaMask wallet. Be mindful of transaction fees and exchange rates during this process.Initiate the withdrawal process: At the ATM, select the option to withdraw cash. The machine will prompt you to specify the amount you wish to withdraw and provide a QR code representing the ATM&rsquo;s wallet address.Transfer funds from MetaMask: Using your MetaMask wallet, scan the QR code provided by the ATM to input the recipient address accurately. Enter the exact amount of cryptocurrency required and confirm the transaction. Be aware that network congestion can affect transaction times.Collect your cash: Once the blockchain confirms the transaction, the ATM will dispense the equivalent amount in cash, minus any applicable fees. This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to longer, depending on network conditions.When using crypto ATMs, you should expect very high fees, and while small transactions don&rsquo;t usually require KYC, larger ones still might.Are MetaMask crypto transactions taxable?Taxes aren&rsquo;t the most exciting topic, but they matter when converting crypto from a MetaMask wallet into fiat. Selling crypto, whether through MetaMask, an exchange or a P2P deal, may trigger a taxable event, and understanding the applicable rules is essential.Selling crypto = possibly taxableIn most countries, including the US, selling crypto for fiat (like US dollars, euros, etc.) is treated like selling property. That means if you bought ETH at $1,000 and sold it later for $1,500, you&rsquo;ve made a $500 capital gain &mdash; and that&rsquo;s usually taxable.Even swapping one crypto for another (say, ETH for USDC) can trigger the same kind of tax obligation, even if no fiat is involved. So, yeah, it&rsquo;s not just cashing out that counts &mdash; any trade can be reportable.To stay on top of it, keep a record of:When you bought and sold each assetHow much you bought and/or soldWhat it was worth in fiat at the timeAny fees paid along the way.These details make life way easier when tax season rolls around &mdash; or if your accountant gives you that look.Know your local rulesCrypto laws aren&rsquo;t one-size-fits-all. Every country has its own stance, and even within the same country, rules can vary depending on how you&rsquo;re using crypto.In the US, for example, selling crypto could fall under capital gains tax rules or even money transmission laws, depending on how you&rsquo;re moving the funds. Other countries might have more lenient &mdash; or much stricter &mdash; regulations.So, here&rsquo;s what to do:Look up your local crypto tax laws (even if they seem vague or outdated).Stay current &mdash; regulations are evolving fast.Talk to a pro if you&rsquo;re unsure. A crypto-savvy accountant or legal adviser can help you avoid nasty surprises.Even if you&rsquo;re using non-KYC methods or decentralized tools, tax authorities may still expect a full report. Being proactive about it will save you headaches later &mdash; and might even save you money.Happy cashing out!",

    "content": "On April 3, yields on long-term US government debt fell to their lowest levels in six months as investors reacted to growing concerns over the global trade war and the weakening of the US dollar. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note briefly touched 4.0%, down from 4.4% a week earlier, signaling strong demand from buyers.US 10-year Treasury yield (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD (right). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphAt first glance, a higher risk of economic recession may seem negative for Bitcoin (BTC). However, lower returns from fixed-income investments encourage allocations to alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies. Over time, traders are likely to reduce exposure to bonds, particularly if inflation rises. As a result, the path to a Bitcoin all-time high in 2025 remains plausible.Tariffs create &lsquo;supply shock&rsquo; in the US and impact inflation and fixed-income returnsOne could argue that the recently announced US import tariffs negatively impact corporate profitability, forcing some companies to deleverage and, in turn, reducing market liquidity. Ultimately, any measure that increases risk aversion tends to have a short-term negative effect on Bitcoin, particularly given its strong correlation with the S&P 500 index.Axel Merk, chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Merk Investments, said that tariffs create a &ldquo;supply shock,&rdquo; meaning the reduced availability of goods and services due to rising prices causes an imbalance relative to demand. This effect is amplified if interest rates are declining, potentially paving the way for inflationary pressure.Source: X/AxelMerkEven if one does not view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, the appeal of fixed-income investments diminishes significantly in such a scenario. Moreover, if just 5% of the world&rsquo;s $140 trillion bond market seeks higher returns elsewhere, it could translate into $7 trillion in potential inflows into stocks, commodities, real estate, gold, and Bitcoin.Weaker US dollar amid gold all-time highs favors alternative assetsGold surged to a $21 trillion market capitalization as it made consecutive all-time highs, and it still has the potential for significant price upside. Higher prices allow previously unprofitable mining operations to resume and it encourages further investment in exploration, extraction, and refining. As production expands, the supply growth will naturally act as a limiting factor on gold&rsquo;s long-term bull run.Regardless of trends in US interest rates, the US dollar has weakened against a basket of foreign currencies, as measured by the DXY Index. On April 3, the index dropped to 102, its lowest level in six months. A decline in confidence in the US dollar, even in relative terms, could encourage other nations to explore alternative stores of value, including Bitcoin.US Dollar Index (DXY). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphThis transition does not happen overnight, but the trade war could lead to a gradual shift away from the US dollar, particularly among countries that feel pressured by its dominant role. While no one expects a return to the gold standard or Bitcoin to become a major component of national reserves, any movement away from the dollar strengthens Bitcoin&rsquo;s long-term upside potential and reinforces its position as an alternative asset.Related: Trump 'Liberation Day' tariffs create chaos in markets, recession concernsTo put things in perspective, Japan, China, Hong Kong, and Singapore collectively hold $2.63 trillion in US Treasuries. If these regions choose to retaliate, bond yields could reverse their trend, increasing the cost of new debt issuance for the US government and further weakening the dollar. In such a scenario, investors would likely avoid adding exposure to stocks, ultimately favoring scarce alternative assets like Bitcoin.Timing Bitcoin&rsquo;s market bottom is nearly impossible, but the fact that the $82,000 support level held despite worsening global economic uncertainty is an encouraging sign of its resilience.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

    "title": "Not a Meme! DePIN Can Take Crypto Mainstream",
    "content": "For years, the crypto market has thrived on speculation, where excitement, hype and fleeting trends attract value instead of fundamentals. Investors have continually poured money into tokens fueled by viral moments, chasing rapid gains. Time and again, a select few of these investments soar to incredible heights, only to come crashing down. With over 33 million tokens in circulation, the competition to attract attention gets harder and harder and investor attention is ever more fleeting. But DePIN can change this. With compelling businesses attracting real customers and revenue built on well designed token economics, DePIN can set a new standard of fundamentals in crypto.As our DePIN Token Economics Report outlines, Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) offer a number of compelling businesses with fundamental value. Unlike typical crypto projects driven by speculation, DePIN offers a different approach. It uses blockchain technology to support real-world infrastructure, creating tangible value and generating real revenue. Instead of relying on hype, it builds a financial system based on actual demand, making it a more sustainable and practical model.Rather than resembling major crypto networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, DePIN operates more like capital-light marketplaces such as Uber and Airbnb, but with key distinctions. While both models connect providers with customers without funding infrastructure, DePIN providers are compensated in tokens that can appreciate in value, akin to Uber drivers or Airbnb hosts receiving equity. Additionally, most DePINs sell to businesses which eliminates the need for massive marketing expenses required in building a consumer brand.DePIN offers a compelling business model and, unlike memes that come and go, it is the beginning of crypto‚Äôs transformation into a mature, revenue-generating industry.From Hype to Revenue-Driven ModelsAt its core, DePIN represents a paradigm shift. Traditionally, blockchain-based businesses have relied on hype to attract buyers. In the absence of traditional fundamentals, the industry cycled through endless metrics such as TPS, TVL, Telegram channel size, followers on X and many others. Many projects have attempted to build decentralized ecosystems. But, without real customers paying for services, they have largely functioned as economies fueled by speculation rather than external demand.DePIN changes this by integrating blockchain technology with physical and digital infrastructure, creating compelling services that generate revenue. Whether it is decentralized cloud computing, wireless networks, mapping or storage solutions, DePIN projects offer services like traditional businesses and with customers who pay for usage. When combined with the correct token economics, it creates a sustainable financial model.As DePIN generates growing revenue, it is likely to draw institutional investors who have long been skeptical of crypto‚Äôs reliance on hype and speculation. The projects that successfully correlate the token demand to actual business growth will not only survive the current market but also set the standard for the next generation of blockchain companiesThe report also highlights one of the most compelling aspects of DePIN, the use of buy-and-burn, which removes the need to have an expanding pool of new buyers. Instead, these projects use a portion of their revenue to repurchase and burn tokens, permanently reducing supply and potentially driving long-term price appreciation similar to stock buybacks.This approach is in stark contrast to most of crypto which relies on new buyers to sustain and grow their value.The buy-and-burn model ensures that as DePIN businesses grow and generate more revenue, their token ecosystems become more resilient to market fluctuations. Some DePIN tokens are already demonstrating this by decoupling from broader crypto market trends, proving that real-world adoption can lead to price stability and long-term investor confidence.Aligning Incentives for Sustainable GrowthWhile DePIN offers significant potential, it also comes with challenges. One major concern is transparency, as most projects lack traditional financial reports, audits, or clear revenue statements. However, blockchain itself provides a solution ‚Äî on-chain verification through buy-and-burn mechanisms allows for real-time financial tracking, giving investors a clearer picture of a project‚Äôs health.Another challenge is customer adoption. Many businesses and consumers remain concerned due to crypto‚Äôs volatility. To address this, DePIN projects are introducing fiat payment options and stablecoin rewards, making it easier for everyday users to interact with these decentralized services without needing prior crypto or Web3 experience.For DePIN to succeed, its incentive structures must be designed to keep all stakeholders ‚Äî providers, users, and investors aligned. One way to achieve alignment is through staking mechanisms, especially in cloud-based networks where service providers lock up tokens as collateral to guarantee reliability. Projects like Filecoin and Fluence already use this approach, ensuring accountability while strengthening network security. Others, such as Render and Livepeer, take a different route by distributing a share of network revenue to token stakers, creating a system similar to dividends that rewards long-term commitment.Governance will also be critical as DePIN projects decentralize. To prevent large token holders from short-term profiteering for quick gains, new governance models like quadratic voting and weighted staking are emerging. These frameworks help keep decision-making balanced, ensuring that projects remain sustainable and fair as they evolve.DePIN isn‚Äôt just another blockchain investment vehicle, it is laying the foundation for real, decentralized infrastructure. While meme coins have shown that crypto can generate hype, they rarely create lasting value. In contrast, DePIN is developing businesses that can compete with centralized companies by focusing on real-world utility.With token models backed by revenue, deflationary supply mechanics, and increasing interest from institutional investors, DePIN is redefining how blockchain networks should function. The projects that successfully address capital efficiency, align incentives, and navigate regulatory challenges will be the ones that lead this next phase of decentralized technology.As DePIN matures, its token models will continue to evolve. Optimizing capital efficiency through transparent buy-and-burn rates will ensure liquidity while maintaining long-term value. Governance structures will adapt to prevent short-term actors from derailing network growth. By 2026, DePIN will be recognized as the benchmark for sustainable blockchain economies, proving that crypto can function as more than a speculative asset class.The crypto industry stands at a crossroads. Investors, developers, and institutions must choose between supporting unsustainable token models or supporting projects that create real value. For the space to mature, it needs to move beyond pure speculation, and DePIN is at the forefront of that transformation.",

    "content": "Both the largest startup funding round ever and the largest acquisition of a venture-backed company occurred in Q1 2025, reflecting a warming startup environment but also one where capital and opportunities were concentrated among a handful of companies and sectors.\n\nOverall, the quarter marked the strongest one for venture investment since Q2 2022.\n\nBut the quarterly numbers were significantly buoyed by a single round: OpenAI raised the largest private round ever, a $40 billion funding that values the company at $300 billion.\n\nThe deal ‚Äî which alone accounts for more than half of U.S. venture funding and a third of global funding last quarter ‚Äî¬†pushed global startup investment in Q1 to $113 billion, Crunchbase data shows. Funding to just the AI sector comprised more than half of last quarter‚Äôs global total.\n\nTotal startup funding in Q1 was up 17% quarter over quarter from $96 billion in Q4 2024 and up 54% year over year from $73 billion in Q1 2024.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBillions more in funding\nU.S. gained\nStrongest M&A quarter since 2021\nAI capital concentrated\nLate stage was up\nEarly stage trails\nSeed falls\nCapEx and concentration\nMethodology\nGlossary of funding terms\n\nBillions more in funding\n\nOpenAI moved from the third-most valuable private company to the second-most valuable after SpaceX, which is currently valued at $350 billion. OpenAI has raised a total of $57.6 billion since its founding in 2015. The latest round represents more than two-thirds of the San Francisco-based company‚Äôs total funding since it was founded, adding to the $6.6 billion it raised in Q4.\n\nCompetitor Anthropic also raised billions in funding in Q1, but even so, it was a fraction of what OpenAI raised. Anthropic raised $4.5 billion across two funding rounds, after raising $4 billion in Q4.\n\nGenerative AI companies were not the only companies to raise billion-dollar rounds in Q1. U.S.-based immersive reality company Infinite Reality raised $3 billion, and crypto asset company Binance raised $2 billion.\n\nBy comparison, the peak quarter of 2024 was Q4 with $96 billion in total funding. That quarter included a spate of billion-dollar rounds to U.S.-based data and AI companies. Databricks, OpenAI, xAI and Anthropic collectively raised $26.6 billion ‚Äî a quarter of global funding.\nU.S. gained\n\nVenture funding to U.S. companies totaled $80 billion in Q1 2025, accounting for around 71% of global funding. Funding to Bay Area-based companies alone reached $55 billion, accounting for 69% of U.S. venture capital funding and 49% of global funding.\nStrongest M&A quarter since 2021\n\nQ1 2025 was also the strongest quarter for startup M&A dollar volume since 2021, totaling $71 billion in reported exit value.\n\nWiz‚Äôs acquisition by Google, if finalized, will mark the largest acquisition for a private company with a price tag of $32 billion. The deal is still subject to regulatory approval.\n\nIn total, there were 12 acquisitions above $1 billion for venture-backed startups. The most notable include Ampere‚Äôs acquisition by SoftBank, Modernizing Medicine‚Äôs purchase by Clearlake Capital Group, Moveworks‚Äô acquisition by ServiceNow, and Weights & Biases‚Äô purchase by CoreWeave.\n\nWhile the dollar volume for global M&A was high, deal counts for the quarter came in at more than 500, but remained well below market peak quarters of the around 800 global M&A deals seen in 2021, Crunchbase data shows.\n\nGlobal M&A for venture-backed companies averaged $63 billion each quarter in 2021, with a peak quarter that year at $71 billion, Crunchbase data shows.\nAI capital concentrated\n\nAI was the leading sector for venture funding in the first quarter, with $59.6 billion invested. Last quarter marked the strongest quarter for AI funding ever, with an astonishing 53% of global funding going to the AI sector alone.\n\nThis followed a strong fourth quarter when $44 billion was raised by AI startups globally.\n\nHealthcare and biotech was the second-largest sector for funding in Q1, with $18 billion invested. Financial services companies, the third-largest sector in the quarter, totaled $10.8 billion.\n\nLate stage was up\n\nLate-stage funding in the first quarter gained quarter over quarter. Funding reached $81 billion, up more than 30% quarter over quarter and an increase of 147% year over year from the $33 billion invested in Q1 2024, Crunchbase data shows.\n\nEarly stage trails\n\nEarly-stage funding was slightly down in Q1 reaching $24 billion. Larger Series A and B rounds were led by the healthcare and biotech sector. Large rounds were also found in robotics, AI and cloud services, among other sectors.\n\nSeed falls\n\nSeed funding reached $7.2 billion in Q1, down 14% from $8.4 billion invested a year ago. (Seed funding totals typically increase over time, as many seed rounds are added to the Crunchbase dataset after the close of a quarter.)\n\nCapEx and concentration\n\nThe venture markets are adapting to the massive opportunities that AI unleashes and the imposing costs of its computation. Last quarter tells that story, with more than a third of capital invested in a single company, OpenAI.\n\nValuations are increasing at a faster pace. The Crunchbase Unicorn Board has added around $400 billion in value in the first quarter ‚Äî from¬† the 29 companies that joined and from existing unicorns that raised rounds at higher values. The board reached $1 trillion in total funding in January this year and currently tops $5.8 trillion in value.\n\nThe IPO markets for tech companies were slow in Q1. The most high-profile company to go public was New Jersey-based CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure cloud service provider. Its shares priced below their range at $40 per share, but have since seen a significant uptick in price.\n\nWith future large outcomes, M&A has heated up, providing some much-needed liquidity to the venture capital industry.\nMethodology\n\nThe data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of April 2, 2025.\n\nNote that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.\n\nPlease note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.\nGlossary of funding terms\n\nSeed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.\n\nEarly-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.\n\nLate-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the ‚ÄúSeries [Letter]‚Äù naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round.\n\nTechnology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a ‚Äúventure‚Äù round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

    "title": "Tariff-Induced Market Meltdown Worrisome For Startup Valuations And Exits",
    "content": "Unlike public companies, private startup valuations don‚Äôt fluctuate massively from day to day based on current events.\n\nEventually, however, private company prices do adjust to reflect trends in the broader markets.\n\nAnd based on what we‚Äôre seeing today, things look worrisome.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index was down a staggering 4.8% in midday trading today, following President Trump‚Äôs decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imported goods. His order calls for a 10% baseline tariff, along with much higher rates for many countries.\n\nAmong its myriad impacts, the decision is expected to lead to higher consumer prices and depressed demand as manufacturers and retailers pass along tariff costs incurred by their businesses. That was reflected in some of today‚Äôs more pronounced drops¬†1 for tech and consumer bellwethers, including Amazon (down 7%), Apple (down 8%),¬† Nike (down 10%), and Wayfair (down 25%).\nStartup correction delayed?\n\nNow, over in startupland, we‚Äôre not seeing immediate revaluations. For hot startups, repricings might happen once every few months or quarters when there‚Äôs a new funding round. And ordinarily, it‚Äôs common for companies to go a couple years between revaluations.\n\nThat means the $300 billion post-money valuation announced for OpenAI this week, and the $113 billion valuation set for the newly combined X and xAI aren‚Äôt seeing an instant price cut like leading AI chip supplier Nvidia (down 5%).\n\nBut looking ahead, the trajectory appears concerning.\n\nFor one, it‚Äôs only a couple years since the last massive startup valuation correction. Scores of companies that enjoyed unicorn status around the market peak in late 2021 later settled for down rounds, folded or filed for bankruptcy.\n\nIn addition, the tech IPO market was sluggish in 2023 and 2024, and only just recently shows signs of warming up. We had a mega-offering last week from CoreWeave, which had a recent market cap around $24 billion. Large offerings from Klarna and Circle are also expected to hit markets in coming weeks.\n\nIn a similar vein, M&A was also on the rise, led by Google‚Äôs planned $32 billion purchase of cybersecurity unicorn Wiz, and a bump in billion-dollar-plus acquisitions.\n\nSo, for startup exits, we were finally getting out of a slump, only to face a new obstacle in the form of a tariff-driven market pullback.\nDumb + unpopular = a case for optimism\n\nLooking for a case for optimism in the current scenario, I find myself turning to reality TV. The principle of this media niche has long been that one can succeed with something dumb, so long as it‚Äôs popular. However, if a show is both pointlessly stupid and not fun to watch, it will flop.\n\nThe same notion applies to a lot of other areas, including movies, music, romance novels, podcasts, and the list goes on. So why not new tariffs?\n\nAs public markets have demonstrated today, investors find the current tariff moves both dumb and unpopular. Hopefully, those with power to revise foolish decisions will take this as a reason to reverse course. I‚Äôm not giving it the highest likelihood, but it‚Äôs at least within the realm of possibility.\nRelated reading:\n\nWith Google‚Äôs $32B Bid For Wiz, Big Exits Are Finally Picking Up\nA Booming Start To The Year For The Billion-Dollar Exits Board\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman\n\nBased on prices at around noon ET.&#8617;",

That‚Äôs why the firm has rolled out a panoply of products (mining pools, hashrate derivatives, data analytics, ASIC brokerage) to help bitcoin miners, large and small, develop their operations.Aaron Foster, the company‚Äôs director of business development, joined in October 2021, and has seen the team grow from roughly 15 to 85 people in the span of three and a half years.Foster worked a decade in the Canadian energy sector before coming to bitcoin mining, which is one of the reasons why he‚Äôll be speaking about the future of mining in Canada and the U.S. at the BTC & Mining Summit at Consensus this year, May 14-15.In the lead-up to the event, Foster shared with CoinDesk his thoughts on bitcoin miners turning to artificial intelligence, the growing sophistication of the mining industry, and how Luxor‚Äôs products enable miners to hedge various forms of risk.This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.Mining pools allow miners to combine their computational resources to have higher chances of receiving bitcoin block rewards. Can you explain to us how Luxor‚Äôs mining pools work?Aaron Foster: Mining pools are basically aggregators that reduce the variance of solo mining. When you look at solo mining, it's very lottery-esque, meaning that you could be plugging your machines in and you might hit block rewards tomorrow ‚Äî or you might hit it 100 years from now. But you're still paying for energy during that time. At a small scale, it‚Äôs not a big deal, as you scale that up and create a business around it.There is a kind of mining pool called PPLNS, which means Pay-Per-Last-N-Shares. Basically, that means the miner does not get paid unless that mining pool hits the block. That's also due to luck variance, so it‚Äôs no different from that solo miner‚Äôs situation. However, that creates revenue volatility for those large industrial miners.So we‚Äôre seeing the emergence of what we call Full-Pay-Per-Share, or FPPS, and that's Luxor is operating for our bitcoin pool. With FPPS, regardless of whether we find a block or not, we're still paying our miners their revenue based on the number of shares they've submitted to the pool. That gives revenue certainty to miners, assuming hashprice stays the same. We've effectively become an insurance provider.The problem is that you need a very deep and strong balance sheet to support that model, because while we've reduced the variance for miners, that risk is now put on us. So we need to plan for that. But it can be calculated over a long enough period of time. We have different partners in that regard, so that we don't bear the full risk from our balance sheet.Tell me about your ASIC brokerage business.We‚Äôve become one of the leading hardware suppliers on the secondary market. Primarily within North America, but we've shipped to 35+ countries. We deal with everybody from public companies to private companies, institutions to retail.We're primarily a broker, meaning we match buyer and seller, mostly on the secondary market. Sometimes we do interact with ASIC manufacturers, and in certain cases we do take principal positions, meaning we use money from our balance sheet to purchase ASICs and then resell them on the secondary market. But the majority of our volume comes from matching buyers and sellers.Luxor also launched the first hashrate futures contracts.We‚Äôre trying to push the Bitcoin mining space forward. We‚Äôre a hashrate marketplace, depending on how you look at our mining pools, and we wanted to take a big leap and take hashrate to the TradFi world.We wanted to create a tool that allows investors to take a position on hashprice without effectively owning mining equipment. Hashprice is, you know, the hourly or daily revenue that miners get, and that fluctuates a lot. For some people it‚Äôs about hedging, for others it‚Äôs speculation. We‚Äôre creating a tool for miners to sell their hashrate forward and use it as a basic collateral or a way to finance growth.We said, ‚ÄòLet's allow miners to basically sell forward hashrate, receive bitcoin upfront, and then they can take that and do whatever they need to do with it, whether it's purchase ASICs or expand their mining operations.‚Äô It‚Äôs basically the collateralization of hashrate. So they're obligated to send us X amount of hashrate per month for the length of the contract. Before that, they'll receive a certain amount of bitcoin upfront.There‚Äôs a market imbalance between buyers and sellers. We have a lot of buyers, meaning people and institutions wanting to earn yield on their bitcoin. What you‚Äôre lending your bitcoin at is effectively your interest rate. However, you could also look at it like you're purchasing that hashrate at a discount. That's important for institutions or folks that don't want physical exposure to bitcoin mining, but want exposure to hash price or hashrate. They can do that synthetically through purchasing bitcoin and putting it into our market, effectively lending that out, earning a yield, and purchasing that hashrate at a discount.What do you find most exciting about bitcoin mining at the moment?The acceptance and natural progression of our industry into other markets. We can't ignore the AI HPC transition. Instead of building these mega mines that are just massive buildings with power-dense bitcoin mining operations, you're starting to see large miners turning into power infrastructure providers for artificial intelligence.Using bitcoin mining as a stepping stone to a larger, more capital intensive industry like AI is exciting to me, because it kind of gives us a bit more acceptance, because we‚Äôre coming at it from a completely different angle. I think the biggest example is the Core Scientific-CoreWeave deal structure, how they've kind of merged those two businesses together. They're complimentary to each other. And that's really exciting. When you look at our own product roadmap, we have no choice but to follow a similar roadmap to bitcoin miners. A lot of the products that we built for the mining industry are analogous to what is needed at a different level for AI. Mind you, it's a lot simpler in our industry than in AI. We‚Äôre our first step into the HPC space, and it‚Äôs still very early days there.",

The stablecoin recently navigated a brief dip below parity before quickly recovering, demonstrating resilience amid broader market uncertainty as investors seek safe havens during geopolitical instability. Circle's IPO filing has revealed unprecedented insights into the stablecoin ecosystem, including the surprising arrangement where Coinbase receives half of USDC reserve revenue. With major banks JPMorgan and Citibank backing Circle's public offering targeting a $4-5 billion valuation, the move signals growing institutional confidence in regulated stablecoins despite ongoing trade disputes affecting traditional markets. As geopolitical tensions escalate, exchanges like Binance are reporting record stablecoin deposits, with USDC playing a crucial role in derivative trading markets. The stablecoin's stability has made it particularly attractive during recent market volatility, with trading volumes peaking during transition phases as investors seek protection from economic fallout related to international trade conflicts.USDC Technical Analysis HighlightsUSDC maintained a narrow trading range of 0.000829 (0.083%) with an annualized volatility of 1.58%.Price action showed a gradual decline from 1.0006 to sub-parity levels around March 31st.A clear support zone formed at 0.9999, with trading volumes peaking during the transition phase.Recent price action shows a modest recovery trend with increasing buying pressure.

    "title": "Why Is the Crypto Market Down Today and How Traders are Playing BTC, XRP, SOL Dip",
    "content": "The kickstart of heavy tariffs under the Trump administration has ushered in a new chapter of uncertainty and opportunity for the crypto market, one that tends to ebb and flow with changes in the global economy.Tariffs, by design, increase the cost of imported goods, often leading to higher inflation, shifts in supply chains, and fluctuations in currency valuations. A stronger U.S. dollar, driven by tariff-induced trade imbalances, might initially pressure crypto prices downward as investors flock to traditional safe havens.However, prolonged economic uncertainty could fuel bitcoin‚Äôs appeal as a store of value, especially if central banks respond with loose monetary policies. Here‚Äôs how crypto traders and market watchers are approaching the coming months ‚Äî largely expecting muted price action in the near term but bullish in the medium to long term.Rick Maeda, Research Analyst at Presto ResearchTrump‚Äôs tariffs, jumping to 34% on China and 25% on cars from the 10% baseline levy, unnerved global markets and crypto was no exception.Bitcoin sold-off into the $82k level while Ethereum got hit harder, dipping below 1,800.Options flow-wise, there was put buying across tenors as traders hedged against further downside, but implied volatility term structures held relatively steady.Crypto continues to be haunted by Trump‚Äôs trade policies as it faced a similar shock earlier this year when tariffs on Mexico and Canada - 25% each - were floated. Lacking a strong intrinsic narrative, the asset class remains firmly tethered to macro forces, with its macro beta keeping it closely bound to trade war developments. Structurally, a prolonged trade war could continue to batter crypto as it continues to identify as a risk asset rather than the digital gold it once was.Enmanuel Cardozo, Market Analyst at Brickken\"Trump‚Äôs tariffs that rolled out yesterday on April 2, 2025, for a long list of countries, are stirring up the crypto industry in a big way. We saw how bitcoin was at $88,500 flirting with the $90K level but in a span of 4hrs dropped down to around $82,000.In the short term, these tariffs are fueling a lot of volatility in what seems to me a sideways consolidation zone‚Äî, as economic uncertainty drives retail investors toward safer bets like gold or traditional investment vehicles while institutional investors continue to accumulate Bitcoin.Add to that the broader risk-off sentiment‚ÄîJPMorgan‚Äôs survey shows 51% of institutional traders see inflation and tariffs as the top market shapers this year. But looking past the immediate turbulence, there‚Äôs a potential upside for crypto in the long run.These tariffs could weaken the dollar‚Äôs dominance by making imports pricier, which might position bitcoin as a go-to hedge against inflation.As global trade gets more murky, crypto‚Äôs utility for cross-border transactions could potentially gain more appeal, especially with stablecoins stepping up as a workaround for tariff barriers as we‚Äôre already seeing hints of this with government-backed stablecoin adoption.Trump‚Äôs tactic‚Äîwhere tariffs might act by weakening the dollar‚Äîadds another layer. If the easing effect wins, bitcoin could benefit long-term. Either way, I‚Äôll be watching how these tariffs interact with Fed policy and market sentiment to see how crypto adapts to this scenario.\"Alvin Kan, COO at Bitget Wallet\"Trump‚Äôs proposed tariffs risk triggering stagflation‚Äîrising prices without growth‚Äîwhich could undermine confidence in fiat, especially the U.S. dollar. As capital seeks protection from inflation and trade war uncertainty, bitcoin stands out as a neutral, decentralized hedge. If dollar dominance erodes and volatility spikes, BTC demand could rise fast.In a fragmented, protectionist world, bitcoin becomes less about speculation and more about preservation, and smart traders are already positioning accordingly.\"Augustine Fan, Head of Insights, SignalPlus\"Trade partners promised retaliation, while cross assets saw a massive risk-off move, leading to a similar drop in BTC to recent lows. Compared to the move in US equities, which breached recent lows, crypto prices outperformed relatively, with BTC holding above the $80k level as the weaker dollar and stronger gold move is providing markets with a convenient excuse to give bitcoin a little bit of a flight to quality bid.A bold statement from Secretary Bessent blaming the sell-off as a \"Mag-7 problem\" compounded the negative sentiment.Risk off will likely be the consensus move here, as it's hard to imagine Trump pulling a quick 180-degree move after such an aggressive show of force, with US assets likely underperforming with economic growth to show tangible weakness in the near future.We like buying BTC on aggressive dips towards the 76-77k area.\"Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research\"Trump‚Äôs unexpectedly harsh tariffs, including 10-49% tariffs on imports, may have sparked a panic-driven sell-off in the wider market, with ETH and SOL dropping ~6%, and the market shifting to stablecoins as fear spiked.Beyond the initial shock, these tariffs threaten the U.S. economy, which could ripple into crypto markets. Higher import costs‚Äîparticularly from key partners like China ‚Äîcould accelerate inflation, with some models projecting a 2-3% CPI uptick by Q2 2025 if trade wars escalate.Concurrently, the Atlanta Fed‚Äôs GDPNow estimate of a 2.8% GDP decline for Q1 2025 may worsen as consumer spending and business investment falter under tariff pressures.A weakening dollar from economic strain and potential Fed easing could boost BTC as a hedge, with data showing early accumulation trends. However, altcoins may need stronger fundamentals to benefit in the long term.\" Read more: Why Trump's Tariffs Could Actually be Good for Bitcoin",

    "content": "Web2 marketers have long had tricks to track down and \"acquire\" (in ad speak) likely customers. But Web3? Not so much, says ad-tech exec Asaf Nadler.His company Addressable, is out with a new service that Nadler, the chief operating officer, claims will improve the efficacy of Web3 marketing ‚Äî from the perspective of salespeople, of course. It's all about \"retargeting\" the most valuable potential customers: people who very nearly pressed buy, trade, sell, swap, join, but didn't.Finding those folks in Web2 is straightforward given the troves of personal data scattered online. Crypto's trickier because wallets are pseudonymous. The company's database \"bridges the gap,\" he said, and lets companies target their most likely customers.Such precision could be especially important if crypto's bear market deepens into a blowout that pushes new users away. Economic malaise increases what traditional marketers call the \"cost per acquisition\" and what Addressable terms the \"cost per wallet.\"\"Especially in a bear market people aren't as hyped about user acquisition,\" said Nadler, \"But what founders care about is letting the community know they still care and reactivate them.\"Addressable isn't building a doxxing service, says Nadler. While it might know on the backend that John Doe owns wallet abc123, it's not passing that information to the client, say, CoinDEX. Instead its product lets CoinDEX target John Doe with ads so that wallet abc123 becomes a paying customer.Building the inference is Addressable's specialty, he said. The company trawls social media posts for intel that it can cross-check with wallets. Perhaps wallet abc123 interacted with protocols that John Doe follows on X. Or it's made trades that John Doe discussed on Reddit. All these clues can be enough to reverse-engineer a targetable identity.The resulting ad-tech playbook is less an only-in-crypto innovation than a recreation of online marketer's existing capabilities with special twists for the on-chain economy. Companies' Web3 funnels are already incredibly narrow, Nadler said, because potential customers are uniquely difficult to target.\"Rather than pay KOLs, or do very broad activities, what we allow is companies to target only the users that have engaged with you,\" he said. KOLs are key opinion leaders, social media influencers who promote projects to their followers.While Addressable has been around for three years, the retargeting service is new, Nadler said. He said he believes it will be a difference-maker for protocols seeking stickier customers.\"The most horrible thing that can happen to DeFi projects at the moment is if users stop believing in them,\" he said, pointing to targeted advertising as the solution.",

    "content": "Opinion by: Rob Viglione, co-founder and CEO of Horizen LabsCan you trust your AI to be unbiased? A recent research paper suggests it&rsquo;s a little more complicated. Unfortunately, bias isn&rsquo;t just a bug &mdash; it&rsquo;s a persistent feature without proper cryptographic guardrails.A September 2024 study from Imperial College London shows how zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can help companies verify that their machine learning (ML) models treat all demographic groups equally while still keeping model details and user data private.&nbsp;Zero-knowledge proofs are cryptographic methods that enable one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any additional information beyond the statement&rsquo;s validity. When defining &ldquo;fairness,&rdquo; however, we open up a whole new can of worms.&nbsp;Machine learning biasWith machine learning models, bias manifests in dramatically different ways. It can cause a credit scoring service to rate a person differently based on their friends&rsquo; and communities&rsquo; credit scores, which can be inherently discriminatory. It can also prompt AI image generators to show the Pope and Ancient Greeks as people of different races, like Google&rsquo;s AI tool Gemini infamously did last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Spotting an unfair machine learning (ML) model in the wild is easy. If the model is depriving people of loans or credit because of who their friends are, that&rsquo;s discrimination. If it&rsquo;s revising history or treating specific demographics differently to overcorrect in the name of equity, that&rsquo;s also discrimination. Both scenarios undermine trust in these systems.Consider a bank using an ML model for loan approvals. A ZKP could prove that the model isn&rsquo;t biased against any demographic without exposing sensitive customer data or proprietary model details. With ZK and ML, banks could prove they&rsquo;re not systematically discriminating against a racial group. That proof would be real-time and continuous versus today&rsquo;s inefficient government audits of private data.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideal ML model? One that doesn&rsquo;t revise history or treat people differently based on their background. AI must adhere to anti-discrimination laws like the American Civil Rights Act of 1964. The problem lies in baking that into AI and making it verifiable.&nbsp;ZKPs offer the technical pathway to guarantee this adherence.AI is biased (but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be)When dealing with machine learning, we need to be sure that any attestations of fairness keep the underlying ML models and training data confidential. They need to protect intellectual property and users&rsquo; privacy while providing enough access for users to know that their model is not discriminatory.&nbsp;Not an easy task. ZKPs offer a verifiable solution.&nbsp;ZKML (zero knowledge machine learning) is how we use zero-knowledge proofs to verify that an ML model is what it says on the box. ZKML combines zero-knowledge cryptography with machine learning to create systems that can verify AI properties without exposing the underlying models or data. We can also take that concept and use ZKPs to identify ML models that treat everyone equally and fairly.&nbsp;Recent: Know Your Peer &mdash; The pros and cons of KYCPreviously, using ZKPs to prove AI fairness was extremely limited because it could only focus on one phase of the ML pipeline. This made it possible for dishonest model providers to construct data sets that would satisfy the fairness requirements, even if the model failed to do so. The ZKPs would also introduce unrealistic computational demands and long wait times to produce proofs of fairness.In recent months, ZK frameworks have made it possible to scale ZKPs to determine the end-to-end fairness of models with tens of millions of parameters and to do so provably securely.&nbsp;&nbsp;The trillion-dollar question: How do we measure whether an AI is fair?Let&rsquo;s break down three of the most common group fairness definitions: demographic parity, equality of opportunity and predictive equality.&nbsp;Demographic parity means that the probability of a specific prediction is the same across different groups, such as race or sex. Diversity, equity and inclusion departments often use it as a measurement to attempt to reflect the demographics of a population within a company&rsquo;s workforce. It&rsquo;s not the ideal fairness metric for ML models because expecting that every group will have the same outcomes is unrealistic.Equality of opportunity is easy for most people to understand. It gives every group the same chance to have a positive outcome, assuming they are equally qualified. It is not optimizing for outcomes &mdash; only that every demographic should have the same opportunity to get a job or a home loan.&nbsp;Likewise, predictive equality measures if an ML model makes predictions with the same accuracy across various demographics, so no one is penalized simply for being part of a group.&nbsp;In both cases, the ML model is not putting its thumb on the scale for equity reasons but only to ensure that groups are not being discriminated against in any way. This is an eminently sensible fix.Fairness is becoming the standard, one way or anotherOver the past year, the US government and other countries have issued statements and mandates around AI fairness and protecting the public from ML bias. Now, with a new administration in the US, AI fairness will likely be approached differently, returning the focus to equality of opportunity and away from equity.&nbsp;As political landscapes shift, so do fairness definitions in AI, moving between equity-focused and opportunity-focused paradigms. We welcome ML models that treat everyone equally without putting thumbs on the scale. Zero-knowledge proofs can serve as an airtight way to verify ML models are doing this without revealing private data.&nbsp;&nbsp;While ZKPs have faced plenty of scalability challenges over the years, the technology is finally becoming affordable for mainstream use cases. We can use ZKPs to verify training data integrity, protect privacy, and ensure the models we&rsquo;re using are what they say they are.&nbsp;As ML models become more interwoven in our daily lives and our future job prospects, college admissions and mortgages depend on them, we could use a little more reassurance that AI treats us fairly. Whether we can all agree on the definition of fairness, however, is another question entirely.Opinion by: Rob Viglione, co-founder and CEO of Horizen Labs.

This supposedly results in improved flexibility and agility in trade execution on the DEX.Paraswap has seen 18,000 monthly active users over the last month with 4.3 million smart contract interactions over the past 365 days, according to TokenTerminal data. The platform first introduced intents-based trading back in the summer of 2024, with hopes that it would mitigate the negative impact of maximum extractable value (MEV) bots. Since then, ParaSwap submitted orders in three steps. First the order is preprocessed defining the expected trade price, then this is submitted to an auction to determine the most efficient execution strategy considering liquidity and timing. The winning agent executes the trade while taking the user&rsquo;s intent into account and purportedly minimizing MEV exploitation risks.Related: Hyperliquid DEX trading volumes cut into CEX market share: DataA crypto MEV bot is an automated program that exploits profit opportunities in blockchain transaction ordering&mdash;using tactics like front-running and arbitrage to capture extra value.

Beyond the hype, how does Bitcoin remain true to its core values?&nbsp;That&rsquo;s the central theme of the latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, where hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson are joined by Charlie Spears, co-founder of Blockspace Media, to unpack Bitcoin&rsquo;s evolving role in the global financial system.Bitcoin&rsquo;s evolutionFrom the outset, Bitcoin was designed as a decentralized alternative to traditional money.But as adoption has surged, so too has the debate over its scalability and usability. Jenkinson began the conversation by explaining the origins of the original cryptocurrency and how that has shifted over time:&ldquo;It started out as digital gold and electronic money, and it was supposed to be that. And this is why there is that shift towards scaling and different transactional capabilities that people are looking to bring onto the network.&rdquo;The discussion underscores the growing importance of layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network, which aim to make Bitcoin practical for everyday transactions by enabling users to transact in satoshis &mdash; the smallest unit of Bitcoin &mdash; rather than traditional currencies.Related: 4 key Bitcoin metrics suggest $80K BTC price is a discountBitcoin&rsquo;s core principlesDebates over Bitcoin&rsquo;s direction often center on its philosophical roots. Some purists argue that any modification risks altering the essence of what makes Bitcoin unique.&nbsp;Others see thoughtful updates as a way to reinforce its role as a global financial system. Spears compares this to interpreting historical texts:&nbsp;&ldquo;Reading what Satoshi wrote years ago is like analyzing the words of the Founding Fathers. The world changes, and we have to decide what that means for Bitcoin today.&rdquo;The discussion highlights how some proposed upgrades aren&rsquo;t new but were initially removed as a precaution. Now, with Bitcoin&rsquo;s maturity, developers are considering reinstating them to improve functionality.&nbsp;&ldquo;Bitcoin is in the hands of its users,&rdquo; Spears emphasizes. &ldquo;We get to decide what it should be, just as much as those who were there 15 years ago.&rdquo;As Bitcoin continues to evolve, The Clear Crypto Podcast cuts through the noise to deliver insightful conversations about where it&rsquo;s headed next.&nbsp;To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,&nbsp; listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph&rsquo;s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

The last time whales were buying so aggressively was in August 2024 with bitcoin in the $50,000-$60,000 range as the yen carry trade was unwinding. Often considered ‚Äúsmart money,‚Äù whales tend to buy during deep corrections and sell into strength ‚Äî a pattern that has played out consistently over the past eight months.Despite this renewed whale activity, broader market behavior remains bearish, with bitcoin currently down 25% from its all-time high. Glassnode‚Äôs Accumulation Trend Score, which tracks the behavior of different wallet cohorts over a 15-day window, shows that most other investor groups are still in distribution mode.A score closer to 1 signals accumulation, while a score near 0 indicates distribution. With an overall market score of just 0.15, selling pressure remains dominant. This suggests that while whales are starting to buy the dip, broader market sentiment continues to lean bearish, potentially putting further downward pressure on price‚Äîat least in the short term.",

    "content": "Ita√∫ Unibanco, Brazil‚Äôs largest bank by assets, is exploring whether to issue its own stablecoin as regulatory discussions evolve and U.S. financial institutions slowly move into the sector.The decision could hinge on how American institutions fare with their stablecoin rollouts, said Guto Antunes, head of digital assets at Ita√∫. At an industry event in S√£o Paulo, Antunes cited the growing momentum behind blockchain-based settlement systems.‚ÄúIta√∫ has always had stablecoins on its radar. We cannot ignore the strength that blockchain has to settle transactions atomically,‚Äù local media quoted him saying. Stablecoins, for now, remain a ‚Äútopic on the agenda.‚ÄùThe renewed interest in stablecoins comes on the heels of a political shift in the U.S., where lawmakers rejected a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in favor of encouraging private stablecoin alternatives to preserve the dollar‚Äôs dominance.In Brazil, regulators are conducting a public consultation‚ÄîConsulta P√∫blica No. 111‚Äîfocused on how stablecoins might fit into the existing financial system. Antunes said the bank is waiting to see what rules the central bank sets before advancing any internal project.Antunes also raised concerns about a proposed ban on self-custody in Brazil‚Äôs draft stablecoin rules.

    "content": "\"Tornado [Cash] is dead, but privacy won't die,\" an ether enthusiast said on X after Oxbow's Ethereum privacy tools went live on April 1 to facilitate on-chain privacy while dissociating from illicit funds.The sentiment is echoed by the early uptake for the privacy pools, which have processed 238 user deposit transactions, totaling 67.49 ETH in the first three days. The new tool has received a thumbs-up from Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, who was one of the first to deposit ETH.These privacy pools leverage zero-knowledge proofs and commitment schemes to facilitate ether deposits and subsequent withdrawals, in part or whole, while breaking the link between deposits and withdrawal addresses. Think of it like having a specialized bank account to send money while hiding your identity or how much money you have.The architecture comprises the contract layer for managing assets, the zero-knowledge layer to ensure privacy and the association set provider layer that ensures compliance by vetting funds.The three layers work together to preserve privacy while screening transactions for links to illicit actors such as hackers, phishers and scammers. The screening is dynamic, meaning a deposit is accepted but later found malicious, it can be removed.Privacy pools are non-custodial, ensuring users retain full control over their funds, allowing even rejected deposits to move back funds to their original addresses.As of now, the deposit limits are set between 0.1 ETH and 1 ETH, with the promise to increase the same after the initial battle testing period.\"This is only the beginning. The road to making privacy normal again is long and exciting, and we can‚Äôt do it alone!‚Äù 0xbow said on X.",

This means users can trade on Bybit while their assets remain in Zodia's custody, thus reducing exposure to on-exchange risks and preventing co-mingling of funds.The attack on Bybit in February saw nearly $1.5 billion worth of digital assets stolen and was the largest hack of a crypto exchange in dollar terms ever. Such instances give a bloody nose to the prospects of increasing institutional adoption of digital assets, hence the requirement for custody services akin to what institutions would expect in the TradFi world.Zodia Custody CEO Julian Sawyer referred to its product as \"custody and settlement built for institutions, not retrofitted for crypto,\" in an emailed announcement on Thursday.",

    "title": "Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin Slides to $83K as U.S. Tariffs Rattle Stocks, Currencies",
    "content": "CORRECT (April 3, 11:30 UTC): Corrects headline to say bitcoin fell after the announcement; an earlier version of the story said it held steady.By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)Liberation Day is done, and markets finally have clarity on U.S. tariffs. Starting April 5, all U.S. trading partners will face a minimum of a 10% import tariff, with higher, country-specific tariffs kicking in on April 9 for about 60 countries.President Donald Trump introduced the tariffs based on perceived trade imbalances and non-tariff barriers, saying the goal is to encourage reshoring of production, generate revenue to help fund tax cuts and level the playing field for U.S. manufacturers. Among the most affected countries is China, which faces a new 34% tariff on top the existing levy, bringing its total to 54%. Many other Asian economies have also been hit hard, while the European Union faces a 20% tariff.There‚Äôs been growing interest in how the U.S. determined the tariff rates, which the administration called reciprocal. One user on X claims to have cracked the formula: Take a country‚Äôs trade deficit with the U.S. and divide it by that country‚Äôs exports to the U.S. For example, Vietnam exports $136.6 billion to the U.S. and imports just $13.1 billion, resulting in a $123.5 billion trade deficit. When you divide the deficit by exports, you get about 90%, which aligns with the implied reciprocal tariff rate the U.S. has applied.Global stocks are under pressure, with the Nikkei 225 losing 2.8% after dropping as much as 4.6% and the FTSE 100 losing more than 1%. Nasdaq futures are down over 3.5%. Vietnam led losses in Asia, falling 5.5% in its worst single-day drop for over four years.The dollar weakened, too, with the yen rallying to 147 against the U.S. currency and the pound to 1.31. The dollar index (DXY) fell to 102.5. Bitcoin (BTC) remains firm above $83,000, though still below its 200-day moving average of $86,400 ‚Äî a key level it needs to reclaim.The all-important U.S. 10-year Treasury yield is hovering just above 4%, the lowest level since October, which is seen as a positive for the administration to get interest rates down.

He further proposed withdrawing $785,000 from Flowdesk to increase the DAO's treasury, which currently holds $2.4 million and 22.3 million MAGIC tokens valued at $2.3 million.Patten warned that with the current burn rate of $8.3 million annually and a potential decline in MAGIC's value, the DAO could become unsustainable between December 2025 and February 2026 without these changes.Derivatives PositioningBTC, ETH basis on the CME and offshore exchanges is holding at around an annualized 5% after the overnight sell-off.

    "title": "What Is DevSecOps And Why Does It Matter In The Age Of AI?",
    "content": "By Sanket Saurav\n\nInterest in DevSecOps has surged in recent years ‚Äî but many people probably don‚Äôt know what it is, or why it has become especially important for tech companies in the age of AI.\n\nWhen building software, someone has to make sure it doesn‚Äôt contain bugs that can later be exploited by bad actors. Today‚Äôs AI code generation tools can produce vast amounts of code quickly, but often with many hidden vulnerabilities. Adopting DevSecOps helps tech companies mitigate these risks, but it‚Äôs a relatively new approach.\n\nTwenty years ago, most companies deployed their code using three teams: development (writing code), operations (deployment) and security, which usually reviewed the code for vulnerabilities just before shipping. Security was often a reactive step occurring late in the process.\n\nDevelopment and operations eventually merged into DevOps, and in recent years, it became clear that security should be as close to the development process as possible, not an afterthought. DevSecOps was born. A number of changes have made it especially important for tech teams to adopt a robust DevSecOps strategy.\nAI-generated code has intensified security needs\nSanket Saurav of DeepSource\n\nWith today‚Äôs generative AI tools, five developers can generate the work of 20 people. However, automation for code security has not kept pace, creating huge gaps in security compliance. Human reviewers simply can‚Äôt deal with the surge in volume.\n\nStudies on AI-generated code found that almost half the code had bugs that could lead to harmful exploitation. Every company today needs to be using automated code security tools ‚Äî namely static application security testing, or SAST, software ‚Äî so the code they‚Äôre rapidly shipping out doesn‚Äôt shoot them in the foot tomorrow.\nDevelopers are relying more on open source\n\nSoftware developers have been integrating much more open-source code into their projects in recent years, meaning they depend on code that‚Äôs been developed externally and repeatedly modified by individual contributors. Each open-source ‚Äúpackage‚Äù uses an entire chain of third-party code: The average open-source JavaScript package relies on 377 third-party packages, and up to 90% of applications‚Äô code is estimated to be open-sourced.\n\nDevelopers have far less control over the quality and security of these ‚Äúdependencies.‚Äù Real-life examples of this happening include Log4j, a widely used open-source program that had a serious security flaw allowing hackers to take control of devices that used it.\n\nDevSecOps tools such as Software Composition Analysis, or SCA, analyze those open-source components of a codebase for any security vulnerabilities. Because they can do so rapidly and at scale, they can better insulate security-conscious teams.\nSoftware releases have become more frequent\n\nWhile a few years ago, traditional development cycles allowed time for manual security reviews¬† (releases happened every few weeks), software releases now get deployed every few hours. Faster deployments risk creating a ‚Äúsecurity debt‚Äù that compounds with each release.\n\nIt‚Äôs particularly important for automated tools to step in to secure that continuous deployment, or the security debt could lead to vulnerability proliferation, as each undetected flaw becomes the foundation for dozens of dependent features.\nEven smaller startups are being asked to meet security standards\n\nWhile larger companies typically have DevSecOps capabilities, smaller startups have often focused on product development over security. But nowadays, enterprises purchasing B2B SaaS are compelling those providers to obtain SOC2 Type 2 compliance, which demands a holistic security program.\n\nThat can‚Äôt be done without a robust code security strategy and tooling in place.\n\nCode security has always been an important part of software development, but recent trends have shifted security closer to the active software development process, and therefore increased the need for fast and efficient security tools.\n\nSanket Saurav is the co-founder and CEO of DeepSource, a company with a mission to help developers write secure code with static analysis and AI.\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

    "title": "Eye On AI: Massive OpenAI Deal Masks AI‚Äôs Slow Quarter",
    "content": "This column is a look back at the week that was in AI. Read the previous one here.\n\nThe big news in the world of venture and artificial intelligence obviously has been OpenAI&#8216;s massive $40 billion investment led by SoftBank.\n\nThat big-money deal has folks talking, but a deeper look at the funding numbers for AI in Q1 seem to show a slight pullback from investors, in both the private and public markets, as more questions arise concerning how much large enterprises will continue (or start in some cases) throwing at AI tools.\nPrivate market\n\nAs our first-quarter 2025 global venture funding report illustrates, AI funding was again at an all-time high ‚Äî just as it was in Q4 2024.\n\nAfter hitting nearly $44 billion in Q4, total venture funding to AI startups was almost $60 billion in the first quarter of this year. While that seems impressive ‚Äî and it is, to a certain extent ‚Äî it‚Äôs hard to ignore the fact that two-thirds of that amount is directly related to one company and its massive raise led by SoftBank.\n\nIf we put that to the side, AI startups in Q1 raised less than half of what was doled out in Q4 last year, getting about $19.6 billion, per Crunchbase data. The biggest deal ‚Äî aside from OpenAI‚Äôs ‚Äî of the quarter saw Anthropic, a ChatGPT rival with its AI assistant Claude, raise a $3.5 billion funding round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners that valued it at $61.5 billion.\n\nThere were many massive deals for AI startups in Q4, including Databricks‚Äô $10 billion round, OpenAI‚Äôs long-awaited raise of $6.6 billion, and xAI‚Äôs $6 billion in a funding round. In fact, there were 11 rounds of $500 million or more, while Q1 saw just five.\n\nIf one takes that $19.6 billion total, it would be the lowest for a quarter since AI startups raised only $13.9 billion in Q1 2024.\n\nDeal flow for AI startups also dipped in Q1 of this year, with only 1,226 deals announced ‚Äî marking a roughly 25% drop from Q1 last year and more than 150 rounds fewer than Q4.\nPublic market\n\nBut it‚Äôs not just about the private market and venture capital. The poster-child for AI on the public market, Nvidia, had a bad quarter in the stock market in Q1, with shares dropping more than 20%, while semiconductor company AMD‚Äôs shares shaved off nearly 15%.\n\nShares of Oracle, a big player in the U.S.‚Äô new AI endeavor, The Stargate Project, dropped more than 15% for the quarter. The Nasdaq Composite Index ‚Äî a good general indicator of how tech stocks are faring ‚Äî was down about 10% for the quarter.\n\nOf course, the big news on the public market was CoreWeave‚Äôs IPO, but the big event barely made any waves as the stock remained relatively flat after premiering (even after the offering significantly shrank in size).\nCautious investing\n\nCoreWeave‚Äôs IPO¬† ‚Äî which had been looked at as a bellwether for the expected thawing of the IPO market ‚Äî may be the best illustration of investors starting to take a hard look at what‚Äôs going on in a heated market.\n\nAs the IPO approached, there seemed to be more questions and concerns being voiced about how quickly AI adoption will happen for many large companies and how much they are willing to allocate to data center spend. There is also worry that with so many data centers being built, supply could outstrip demand and lower prices.\n\nOf course, Q2 may be an entirely different story in both the private and public markets, and the OpenAI round did, in fact, happen, so that investment can‚Äôt just be discounted.\n\nHowever, there is also a chance investors are starting to look more closely at AI and where the market for spend on the technology is actually going.\n\nThat would be something different.\nRelated Crunchbase Pro query:\n\nRounds Raised By Startups Using AI\n\nRelated reading:\n\nCoreWeave Shrinks IPO\nEye On AI: AI Venture Funding Shattered Quarterly Records In Q4\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

    "title": "Bitcoin‚Äôs Hash Rate Hits Record High, Yet Price and Activity Tell Another Story",
    "content": "Bitcoin blockchain's hashrate is surging, revealing a growing dislocation between the network activity and prices for its native token bitcoin (BTC). On a 14-day moving average, the hashrate, representing the computational power required to mine a block on the proof-of-work Bitcoin blockchain, recently reached an all-time high of 838 exahashes per second (EH/s), and on a 24-hour time frame, it spiked to 974 EH/s, the second highest level ever, according to Glassnode data. Measuring over a 24-hour window can be misleading due to block time variability, so longer timeframes give more reliable insights. In two days, Bitcoin‚Äôs difficulty adjustment ‚Äî which recalibrates every 2016 blocks to maintain a 10-minute block interval ‚Äî is expected to increase by over 3%, reaching a new peak.This divergence between hash rate and price is notable. While bitcoin remains about 25% below its all-time high, mining costs continue to rise. For miners to stay profitable and cover operational expenses and capital expenditures, a strong bitcoin price, full blocks and high transaction fees are essential.Currently, miners earn revenue through two channels: block rewards (3.125 BTC per block in the current epoch) and transaction fees. However, transaction fees are extremely low ‚Äî averaging around 4 BTC per day, or roughly $377,634. As bitcoin‚Äôs block subsidy continues to halve every four years, sustained or increasing transaction activity will be critical to maintaining mining incentives.Near empty blocksDeveloper Mononaut, from Mempool, recently noted that Foundry USA Pool mined the emptiest \"non-empty\" block in over two years, containing just seven transactions ‚Äî a rarity only surpassed by a block with four transactions back in January 2023.In other words, while the rising hashrate paints a picture of a booming network, the near-empty blocks make it the case of a powerful train speeding down the tracks but without passengers. That's a cause for concern for Nicolas Gregory, creator of the Mercury Layer and a former Nasdaq Board Director.‚ÄúHalf-empty bitcoin blocks tell a tale ‚Äî hawking the store-of-value line could scupper its future,\" Gregory said on X.\"I hope bitcoiners realize this space is more than just podcasts, spaces, and the ‚Äònumber go up‚Äô digital gold narrative.

    "title": "We should talk more about air-conditioning",
    "content": "Things are starting to warm up here in the New York City area, and it‚Äôs got me thinking once again about something that people aren‚Äôt talking about enough: energy demand for air conditioners. \n\nI get it: Data centers are the shiny new thing to worry about. And I‚Äôm not saying we shouldn‚Äôt be thinking about the strain that gigawatt-scale computing installations put on the grid. But a little bit of perspective is important here.\n\nAccording to a report from the International Energy Agency last year, data centers will make up less than 10% of the increase in energy demand between now and 2030, far less than the energy demand from space cooling (mostly air-conditioning).\n\nI just finished up a new story that‚Äôs out today about a novel way to make heat exchangers, a crucial component in air conditioners and a whole host of other technologies that cool our buildings, food, and electronics. Let‚Äôs dig into why I‚Äôm writing about the guts of cooling technologies, and why this sector really needs innovation.¬†\n\nOne twisted thing about cooling and climate change: It‚Äôs all a vicious cycle. As temperatures rise, the need for cooling technologies increases. In turn, more fossil-fuel power plants are firing up to meet that demand, turning up the temperature of the planet in the process.\n\n‚ÄúCooling degree days‚Äù are one measure of the need for additional cooling. Basically, you take a preset baseline temperature and figure out how much the temperature exceeds it. Say the baseline (above which you‚Äôd likely need to flip on a cooling device) is 21 ¬∞C (70 ¬∞F). If the average temperature for a day is 26 ¬∞C, that‚Äôs five cooling degree days on a single day. Repeat that every day for a month, and you wind up with 150 cooling degree days.\n\nI explain this arguably weird metric because it‚Äôs a good measure of total energy demand for cooling‚Äîit lumps together both how many hot days there are and just how hot it is. \n\nAnd the number of cooling degree days is steadily ticking up globally. Global cooling degree days were 6% higher in 2024 than in 2023, and 20% higher than the long-term average for the first two decades of the century. Regions that have high cooling demand, like China, India, and the US, were particularly affected, according to the IEA report. You can see a month-by-month breakdown of this data from the IEA here.\n\nThat increase in cooling degree days is leading to more demand for air conditioners, and for energy to power them. Air-conditioning accounted for 7% of the world‚Äôs electricity demand in 2022, and it‚Äôs only going to get more important from here.\n\nThere were fewer than 2 billion AC units in the world in 2016. By 2050, that could be nearly 6 billion, according to a 2018 report from the IEA. This is a measure of progress and, in a way, something we should be happy about; the number of air conditioners tends to rise with household income. But it does present a challenge to the grid.¬†¬†\n\nAnother piece of this whole thing: It‚Äôs not just about how much total electricity we need to run air conditioners but about when that demand tends to come. As we‚Äôve covered in this newsletter before, your air-conditioning habits aren‚Äôt unique. Cooling devices tend to flip on around the same time‚Äîwhen it‚Äôs hot. In some parts of the US, for example, air conditioners can represent more than 70% of residential energy demand at times when the grid is most stressed.\n\nThe good news is that we‚Äôre seeing innovations in cooling technology. Some companies are building cooling systems that include an energy storage component, so they can charge up when energy is plentiful and demand is low. Then they can start cooling when it‚Äôs most needed, without sucking as much energy from the grid during peak hours.\n\nWe‚Äôve also covered alternatives to air conditioners called desiccant cooling systems, which use special moisture-sucking materials to help cool spaces and deal with humidity more efficiently than standard options.\n\nAnd in my latest story, I dug into new developments in heat exchanger technology. Heat exchangers are a crucial component of air conditioners, but you can really find them everywhere‚Äîin heat pumps, refrigerators, and, yes, the cooling systems in large buildings and large electronics installations, including data centers.\n\nWe‚Äôve been building heat exchangers basically the same way for nearly a century. These components basically move heat around, and there are a few known ways to do so with devices that are relatively straightforward to manufacture. Now, though, one team of researchers has 3D-printed a heat exchanger that outperforms some standard designs and rivals others. This is still a long way from solving our looming air-conditioning crisis, but the details are fascinating‚ÄîI hope you‚Äôll give it a read.¬†\n\nWe need more innovation in cooling technology to help meet global demand efficiently so we don‚Äôt stay stuck in this cycle. And we‚Äôll need policy and public support to make sure that these technologies make a difference and that everyone has access to them too. \n\nThis article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review‚Äôs weekly climate newsletter.

He released a statement saying that he's aware of multiple reports this year of alleged fraud exploiting trust companies, and acknowledged that local regulation needs to be improved.First Digital Trust denies all allegationsAfter Sun's press conference, First Digital Trust held its own event on X, with CEO Vincent Chok saying Sun had yet to produce \"one solid piece of evidence\" to back up his claims.FDT followed its fiduciary duties, acted in clients' best interests, complied with instructions from Sun and his nominees, which were signed off by Techteryx directors, and noted that the company is subject to third-party audits, Chok said.Chok, however, acknowledged he was previously unaware of the familial connection between Aria CFF and Aria DMCC ‚Äî the funds where TUSD's reserves are held up.In a complaint to the Department of Justice, Techteryx noted that Aria CFF, the fund it said is authorized to hold TrueUSD's reserves is managed by Matthew Brittain.

    "title": "Rivals are rising to challenge the dominance of SpaceX",
    "content": "SpaceX is a space launch juggernaut. In just two decades, the company has managed to edge out former aerospace heavyweights Boeing, Lockheed, and Northrop Grumman to gain near-monopoly status over rocket launches in the US; it accounted for 87% of the country‚Äôs orbital launches in 2024, according to an analysis by SpaceNews. Since the mid-2010s, the company has dominated NASA‚Äôs launch contracts and become a major Pentagon contractor. It is now also the go-to launch provider for commercial customers, having lofted numerous satellites and five private crewed spaceflights, with more to come. \n\nOther space companies have been scrambling to compete for years, but developing a reliable rocket takes slow, steady work and big budgets. Now at least some of them are catching up. \n\nA host of companies have readied rockets that are comparable to SpaceX‚Äôs main launch vehicles. The list includes Rocket Lab, which aims to take on SpaceX‚Äôs workhorse Falcon 9 with its Neutron rocket and could have its first launch in late 2025, and Blue Origin, owned by Jeff Bezos, which recently completed the first mission of a rocket it hopes will compete against SpaceX‚Äôs Starship. \n\nSome of these competitors are just starting to get rockets off the ground. And the companies could also face unusual headwinds, given that SpaceX‚Äôs Elon Musk has an especially close relationship with the Trump administration and has allies at federal regulatory agencies, including those that provide oversight of the industry.\n\nBut if all goes well, the SpaceX challengers can help improve access to space and prevent bottlenecks if one company experiences a setback. ‚ÄúMore players in the market is good for competition,‚Äù says Chris Combs, an aerospace engineer at the University of Texas at San Antonio. ‚ÄúI think for the foreseeable future it will still be hard to compete with SpaceX on price.‚Äù But, he says, the competitors could push SpaceX itself to become better and provide those seeking access to space with a wider array of options..\n\nA big lift\n\nThere are a few reasons why SpaceX was able to cement its position in the space industry. When it began in the 2000s, it had three consecutive rocket failures and seemed poised to fold. But it barreled through with Musk‚Äôs financial support, and later with a series of NASA and defense contracts. It has been a primary beneficiary of NASA‚Äôs commercial space program, developed in the 2010s with the intention of propping up the industry. \n\n‚ÄúThey got government contracts from the very beginning,‚Äù says Victoria Samson, a space policy expert at the Secure World Foundation in Broomfield, Colorado. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a handout, but SpaceX would not exist without a huge influx of repeated government contracts. To this day, they‚Äôre still dependent on government customers, though they have commercial customers too.‚Äù\n\nSpaceX has also effectively achieved a high degree of vertical integration, Samson points out: It owns almost all parts of its supply chain, designing, building, and testing all its major hardware components in-house, with a minimal use of suppliers. That gives it not just control over its hardware but considerably lower costs, and the price tag is the top consideration for launch contracts. \n\nThe company was also open to taking risks other industry stalwarts were not. ‚ÄúI think for a very long time the industry looked at spaceflight as something that had to be very precise and perfect, and not a lot of room for tinkering,‚Äù says Combs. ‚ÄúSpaceX really was willing to take some risks and accept failure in ways that others haven‚Äôt been. That‚Äôs easier to do when you‚Äôre backed by a billionaire.‚Äù \n\nWhat‚Äôs finally enabled international and US-based competitors to emerge has been a growing customer base looking for launch services, along with some investors‚Äô deep pockets. \n\nSome of these companies are taking aim at SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9, which can lift as much as about 20,000 kilograms into orbit and is used for sending multiple satellites or the crewed Dragon into space. ‚ÄúThere is a practical monopoly in the medium-lift launch market right now, with really only one operational vehicle,‚Äù says Murielle Baker, a spokesperson for Rocket Lab, a US-New Zealand company.\n\nRocket Lab plans to take on the Falcon 9 with its Neutron rocket, which is expected to have its inaugural flight later this year from NASA‚Äôs Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. The effort is building on the success of the company‚Äôs smaller Electron rocket, and Neutron‚Äôs first stage is intended to be reusable after it parachutes down to the ocean. \n\nAnother challenger is Texas-based Firefly, whose Alpha rocket can be launched from multiple spaceports so that it can reach different orbits. Firefly has already secured NASA and Space Force contracts, with more launches coming this year (and on March 2 it also became the second private company to successfully land a spacecraft on the moon). Next year, Relativity Space aims to loft its first Terran R rocket, which is partially built from 3D-printed components. And the Bill Gates‚Äìbacked Stoke Space aims to launch its reusable Nova rocket in late 2025 or, more likely, next year.\n\nCompetitors are also rising for SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon Heavy, holding out the prospect of more options for sending massive payloads to higher orbits and deep space. Furthest along is the Vulcan Centaur rocket, a creation of United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. It‚Äôs expected to have its third and fourth launches in the coming months, delivering Space Force satellites to orbit. Powered by engines from Blue Origin, the Vulcan Centaur is slightly wider and shorter than the Falcon rockets. It currently isn‚Äôt reusable, but it‚Äôs less expensive than its predecessors, ULA‚Äôs Atlas V and Delta IV, which are being phased out. \n\nMark Peller, the company‚Äôs senior vice president on Vulcan development and advanced programs, says the new rocket comes with multiple advantages. ‚ÄúOne is overall value, in terms of dollars per pound to orbit and what we can provide to our customers,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúand the second is versatility: Vulcan was designed to go to a range of orbits.‚Äù He says more than 80 missions are already lined up. \n\nVulcan‚Äôs fifth flight, slated for no earlier than May, will launch the long-awaited Sierra Space Dream Chaser, a spaceplane that can carry cargo (and possibly crew) to the International Space Station. ULA also has upcoming Vulcan launches planned for Amazon‚Äôs Kuiper satellite constellation, a potential Starlink rival.\n\nMeanwhile, though it took a few years, Blue Origin now has a truly orbital heavy-lift spacecraft: In January, it celebrated the inaugural launch of its towering New Glenn, a rocket that‚Äôs only a bit shorter than NASA‚Äôs Space Launch System and SpaceX‚Äôs Starship. Future flights could launch national security payloads. \n\nCompetition is emerging abroad as well. After repeated delays, Europe‚Äôs heavy-lift Ariane 6, from Airbus subsidiary Arianespace, had its inaugural flight last year, ending the European Space Agency‚Äôs temporary dependence on SpaceX. A range of other companies are trying to expand European launch capacity, with assistance from ESA.\n\nChina is moving quickly on its own launch organizations too. ‚ÄúThey had no less than seven ‚Äòcommercial‚Äô space launch companies that were all racing to develop an effective system that could deliver a payload into orbit,‚Äù Kari Bingen, director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says of China‚Äôs efforts. ‚ÄúThey are moving fast and they have capital behind them, and they will absolutely be a competitor on the global market once they‚Äôre successful and probably undercut what US and European launch companies are doing.‚Äù The up-and-coming Chinese launchers include Space Pioneer‚Äôs reusable Tianlong-3 rocket and Cosmoleap‚Äôs Yueqian rocket. The latter is to feature a ‚Äúchopstick clamp‚Äù recovery of the first stage, where it‚Äôs grabbed by the launch tower‚Äôs mechanical arms, similar to the concept SpaceX is testing for its Starship.\n\nGlitches and government\n\nBefore SpaceX‚Äôs rivals can really compete, they need to work out the kinks, demonstrate the reliability of their new spacecraft, and show that they can deliver low-cost launch services to customers. \n\nThe process is not without its challenges. Boeing‚Äôs Starliner delivered astronauts to the ISS on its first crewed flight in June 2024, but after thruster malfunctions, they were left stranded at the orbital outpost for nine months. While New Glenn reached orbit as planned, its first stage didn‚Äôt land successfully and its upper stage was left in orbit. \n\nSpaceX itself has had some recent struggles. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded the Falcon 9 more than once following malfunctions in the second half of 2024. The company still shattered records last year, though, with more than 130 Falcon 9 launches. It has continued with that record pace this year, despite additional Falcon 9 delays and more glitches with its booster and upper stage. SpaceX also conducted its eighth Starship test flight in March, just two months after the previous one, but both failed minutes after liftoff, raining debris down from the sky.\n\nAny company must deal with financial challenges as well as engineering ones. Boeing is reportedly considering selling parts of its space business, following Starliner‚Äôs malfunctions and problems with its 737 Max aircraft. And Virgin Orbit, the launch company that spun off from Virgin Galactic, shuttered in 2023.\n\nAnother issue facing would-be commercial competitors to SpaceX in the US is the complex and uncertain political environment. Musk does not manage day-to-day operations of the company. But he has close involvement with DOGE, a Trump administration initiative that has been exerting influence on the workforces and budgets of NASA, the Defense Department, and regulators relevant to the space industry. \n\nJared Isaacman, a billionaire who bankrolled the groundbreaking 2021 commercial mission Inspiration4, returned to orbit, again via a SpaceX craft, on Polaris Dawn last September. Now he may become Trump‚Äôs NASA chief, a position that could give him the power to nudge NASA toward awarding new lucrative contracts to SpaceX. In February it was reported that SpaceX‚Äôs Starlink might land a multibillion-dollar FAA contract previously awarded to Verizon. \n\nIt is also possible that SpaceX could strengthen its position with respect to the regulatory scrutiny it has faced for environmental and safety issues at its production and launch sites on the coasts of Texas and Florida, as well as scrutiny of its rocket crashes and the resulting space debris. Oversight from the FAA, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Environmental Protection Agency may be weak. Conflicts of interest have already emerged at the FAA, and the Trump administration has also attempted to incapacitate the National Labor Relations Board. SpaceX had previously tried to block the board from acting after nine workers accused the company of unfair labor practices.\n\nSpaceX did not respond to MIT Technology Review‚Äôs requests for comment for this story.\n\n‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs going to be a lot of emphasis to relieve a lot of the regulations, in terms of environmental impact studies, and things like that,‚Äù Samson says. ‚ÄúI thought there‚Äôd be a separation between [Musk‚Äôs] interests, but now, it‚Äôs hard to say where he stops and the US government begins.‚Äù\n\nRegardless of the politics, the commercial competition will surely heat up throughout 2025. But SpaceX has a considerable head start, Bingen argues: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to take a lot for these companies to effectively compete and potentially dislodge SpaceX, given the dominant position that [it has] had.‚Äù\n\nRamin Skibba is an astrophysicist turned science writer and freelance journalist, based in the Bay Are",

    "title": "The machines are rising ‚Äî but developers still hold the keys",
    "content": "Rumors of the ongoing death of software development ‚Äî that it‚Äôs being slain by AI ‚Äî are greatly exaggerated. In reality, software development is at a fork in the road: embracing the (currently) far-off notion of fully automated software development or acknowledging the work of a software developer is much more than just writing lines of code.\n\nThe decision the industry makes could have significant long-term consequences. Increasing complacency around AI-generated code and a shift to what has been termed ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù ‚Äî where code is generated through natural language prompts until the results seem to work ‚Äî will lead to code that‚Äôs more error-strewn, more expensive to run and harder to change in the future. And, if the devaluation of software development skills continues, we may even lack a workforce with the skills and knowledge to fix things down the line. \n\nThis means software developers are going to become more important to how the world builds and maintains software. Yes, there are many ways their practices will evolve thanks to AI coding assistance, but in a world of proliferating machine-generated code, developer judgment and experience will be vital.\n\nThe dangers of AI-generated code are already here\n\nThe risks of AI-generated code aren‚Äôt science fiction: they‚Äôre with us today. Research done by GitClear earlier this year indicates that with AI coding assistants (like GitHub Copilot) going mainstream, code churn ‚Äî which GitClear defines as ‚Äúchanges that were either incomplete or erroneous when the author initially wrote, committed, and pushed them to the company‚Äôs git repo&#8221; ‚Äî has significantly increased. GitClear also found there was a marked decrease in the number of lines of code that have been moved, a signal for refactored code (essentially the care and feeding to make it more effective).\n\nIn other words, from the time coding assistants were introduced there‚Äôs been a pronounced increase in lines of code without a commensurate increase in lines deleted, updated, or replaced. Simultaneously, there&#8217;s been a decrease in lines moved ‚Äî indicating a lot of code has been written but not refactored. More code isn‚Äôt necessarily a good thing (sometimes quite the opposite); GitClear‚Äôs findings ultimately point to complacency and a lack of rigor about code quality.\n\nCan AI be removed from software development?\n\nHowever, AI doesn‚Äôt have to be removed from software development and delivery. On the contrary, there‚Äôs plenty to be excited about. As noted in the latest volume of the Technology Radar ‚Äî Thoughtworks‚Äô report on technologies and practices from work with hundreds of clients all over the world ‚Äî the coding assistance space is full of opportunities. \n\nSpecifically, the report noted tools like Cursor, Cline and Windsurf can enable software engineering agents. What this looks like in practice is an agent-like feature inside developer environments that developers can ask specific sets of coding tasks to be performed in the form of a natural language prompt. This enables the human/machine partnership.\n\nThat being said, to only focus on code generation is to miss the variety of ways AI can help software developers. For example, Thoughtworks has been interested in how generative AI can be used to understand legacy codebases, and we see a lot of promise in tools like Unblocked, which is an AI team assistant that helps teams do just that. In fact, Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Code helped us add support for new languages in an internal tool, CodeConcise. We use CodeConcise to understand legacy systems; and while our success was mixed, we do think there‚Äôs real promise here.\n\nTightening practices to better leverage AI\n\nIt‚Äôs important to remember much of the work developers do isn‚Äôt developing something new from scratch. A large proportion of their work is evolving and adapting existing (and sometimes legacy) software. Sprawling and janky code bases that have taken on technical debt are, unfortunately, the norm. Simply applying AI will likely make things worse, not better, especially with approaches like vibe. \n\nThis is why developer judgment will become more critical than ever. In the latest edition of the Technology Radar report, AI-friendly code design is highlighted, based on our experience that AI coding assistants perform best with well-structured codebases. \n\nIn practice, this requires many different things, including clear and expressive naming to ensure context is clearly communicated (essential for code maintenance), reducing duplicate code, and ensuring modularity and effective abstractions. Done together, these will all help make code more legible to AI systems.\n\nGood coding practices are all too easy to overlook when productivity and effectiveness are measured purely in terms of output, and even though this was true before there was AI tooling, software development needs to focus on good coding first.\n\nAI assistance demands greater human responsibility\n\nInstagram co-founder Mike Krieger recently claimed that in three years software engineers won‚Äôt write any code: they will only review AI-created code. This might sound like a huge claim, but it‚Äôs important to remember that reviewing code has always been a major part of software development work. With this in mind, perhaps the evolution of software development won‚Äôt be as dramatic as some fear.\n\nBut there‚Äôs another argument: as AI becomes embedded in how we build software, software developers will take on more responsibility, not less. This is something we‚Äôve discussed a lot at Thoughtworks: the job of verifying that an AI-built system is correct will fall to humans. Yes, verification itself might be AI-assisted, but it will be the role of the software developer to ensure confidence. \n\nIn a world where trust is becoming highly valuable ‚Äî as evidenced by the emergence of the chief trust officer ‚Äî the work of software developers is even more critical to the infrastructure of global industry. It‚Äôs vital software development is valued: the impact of thoughtless automation and pure vibes could prove incredibly problematic (and costly) in the years to come.\n\nThis content was produced by Thoughtworks.

    "title": "Founders, Here‚Äôs How Not To Be Thrown Overboard After A Big Fundraise",
    "content": "By Dan Lifshits\n\nRaising capital is an inevitable step for almost any startup founder ‚Äî unless you‚Äôre building a business that is profitable from day one. However, a big raise comes with big responsibility ‚Äî not just for the capital itself, but also for maintaining solid investor relations. This involves clear, transparent communication, as otherwise, you risk being nothing more than a bystander, watching your idea come to life or fall apart without you.\n\nHistory repeats itself far too often for us not to learn its lessons: The curtain call for Jack Dorsey, the boardroom battle that led to the departure of Steve Jobs, and ‚Äî how could we forget? ‚Äî the investor-driven departure of Jerry Yang from Yahoo.\n\nCases like these are countless; you could fill an entire book with them. But is it possible to take control of such subjective things? Well, at least you can try. Here&#8217;s how.\nIt‚Äôs the investor, not the fund, that matters\nDan Lifshits of Dwelly\n\nIf you don‚Äôt want to get the boot right after a raise, do your homework. Too many founders flex about which fund backed them ‚Äî ‚ÄúI raised from Andreessen Horowitz,‚Äù ‚ÄúI got General Catalyst,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSequoia‚Äôs in my round‚Äù ‚Äî but they miss the real question: Who at that fund actually wrote the check?\n\nA fund is important, but its true value lies in its partners ‚Äî their vision, approaches and ways of working, each unique in its own way. The name on the cap table matters less than the person sitting across from you in board meetings.\n\nIf you have options, go beyond a firm‚Äôs reputation and dig into the actual investor you‚Äôll be working with. Are they hands-on or hands-off? Do they back founders through tough times, or do they cut and run? Have they gone through the same journey you are experiencing now yourself?\n\nSometimes, the best choice isn‚Äôt the flashiest fund but the partner who truly gets your vision, has a strong conviction in it, and is ready to go all-in with you.\n\nAnd remember: bringing on an investor is like entering a marriage. It‚Äôs a long-term relationship built on trust, shared values and a collective commitment to success because you&#8217;ll be building together for at least seven to 10 years.\n\nBut unlike marriage, founders don‚Äôt always have the luxury of picking the perfect match. When you need funding, you often need it fast, and that means compromises are inevitable. The key is knowing which trade-offs are worth making and which could come back to haunt you.\n\nTalk to founders they‚Äôve backed. Do the due diligence. The right investor can be a game-changer. The wrong one? A disaster.\nTrust your gut: Red flags only get redder\n\nIf something feels off about a potential investor ‚Äî maybe it‚Äôs their approach to business, their values or how they handle tough situations ‚Äî pay attention. Fortunately, your gut is rarely wrong. This is someone you‚Äôll be working with for years, through the highs and inevitable lows.\n\nThe last thing you want is a boardroom full of doubt and friction. The stakes are too high to ignore red flags or convince yourself it‚Äôll ‚Äúprobably be fine.‚Äù If it doesn‚Äôt feel right now, it definitely won‚Äôt feel right later.\nWhen the honeymoon is over\n\nSome founders treat investors like ATMs, only reaching out when they need more cash. While this might seem efficient, it doesn‚Äôt build the trust needed to keep you in control when things get tough.\n\nThe best founders understand that investor relationships aren‚Äôt just about business metrics ‚Äî they‚Äôre about mutual trust, transparency and alignment. This means maintaining open, honest communication ‚Äî not only during good times, but especially when things aren‚Äôt going as planned.\n\nRegular updates, both wins and challenges, create predictability and reliability. And when a crisis hits, the investors who trust you are the ones who‚Äôll stand by you. Those you‚Äôve kept at arm‚Äôs length? They‚Äôll be the first to push you out.\n\nDan Lifshits is the COO and co-founder of Dwelly, an AI-powered proptech startup reshaping the U.K. market through a roll-up strategy. Previously, as general manager at Gett, he led the turnaround of a $100 million business, increasing EBITDA by $3.5 million per month.

    "title": "As US Defense Tech Surges, Europe Lags",
    "content": "Last week, news broke that Anduril Industries ‚Äî perhaps the poster child for defense tech startups ‚Äî is considering plans to open a factory in the U.K.\n\nThe startup, valued now at $14 billion, recently received a nearly $40 million contract from the U.K. government to supply drones to Ukraine ‚Äî as the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues into its third year, as does conflict in the Middle East region.\n\nHowever, those geopolitical tensions have not convinced investors across the pond to start pouring millions into the defense tech sector like their U.S. counterparts.\n\nDefense tech investing in Europe hit a new high last year, with nearly $626 million being plowed into VC-backed startups in the industry, per Crunchbase data.\n\nHowever, that amount accounts for less than one-fifth of the nearly $3.2 billion invested globally in VC-backed defense tech startups, and is dwarfed by the $2.5 billion that went to such startups in the U.S.\n\nWhile it‚Äôs true Europe makes up about one-sixth of the global venture market in general, it‚Äôs also worth noting that the vast majority of the continent‚Äôs defense tech money went to one round: Helsing, which develops artificial intelligence software for defense applications, raised about $489 million in funding led by General Catalyst that valued the company at $5.4 billion in July. The Germany-based startup designs software that helps boost weapons capabilities in drones and jet fighters, and improves battlefield decision-making.\nU.S. dominance\n\nThe Helsing round represents the only round raised by a Europe-based defense tech startup of more than $80 million.\n\nNext on the list are aerospace and defense tech startup The Tekever Group, which raised a Series B worth about $75 million, and Germany-based FibreCoat, a thermoplastic-coated fibres developer that raised a Series B worth more than $21 million last year.\n\nThat is quite different from the numbers U.S.-based defense tech startups put up last year. The $2.5 billion such startups locked up in the U.S. in 67 deals ‚Äî per Crunchbase data ‚Äî included 14 deals bigger than $14 billion.\n\nThey included monster rounds such as Anduril Industries‚Äô massive $1.5 billion in a Series F, autonomous surface vessels maker Saronic‚Äôs $175 million Series B at a $1 billion valuation, and defense and critical infrastructure tech startup Chaos Industries‚Äô $145 million in a Series B.\nRoom to grow?\n\nU.S.-based defense tech startups have continued their big-money fundraising trend into this year. Already, U.S. startups have raised $1.5 billion in just 15 deals.\n\nEurope, on the other hand, has seen similar startups raise just more than $1 million in a couple of deals.\n\nWhile the European numbers are small, there is a chance that could change.\n\nJust last year, the NATO Innovation Fund made its first investments and has now completed more than a half-dozen deals into startups. It has also backed ‚Äúventure capital fund managers that invest in early-stage deep tech with a focus on civilian, and defence, security and resilience markets.‚Äù\n\nThere is also the fact the U.S. is often ahead of the curve on the next hot sector to invest in as far as startups go. Europe, especially considering changing world politics and current conflicts, may quickly turn to defense tech as a logical investment opportunity.\n\nHowever, there is a long way to go. U.S.-based startups closed nearly 3x the number of funding rounds last year as did their European brethren: 67 vs 23.\n\nBoth deal flow and dollars will have to increase if Europe is even to come close to the current funding environment in the U.S. around defense tech.\nMethodology\n\nDefense tech is defined by the industries of military, national security and law enforcement, according to Crunchbase data. Most announced rounds are represented in the database; however, there could be a small time lag for rounds reported late in the quarter. It does not include incubators or accelerators due to the fluctuations their investment numbers can have.\nRelated Crunchbase Pro list:\n\nGlobal Defense Tech Funding\nEurope Defense Tech Funding\nUS Defense Tech Funding\n\nRelated reading:\n\nDefense Tech Venture Funding Gains Traction\nWeapons Startup Castelion Strikes $100M Series A\nA16z And Founders Fund Lead The Way In Defense Venture Capital\nChaos Industries Lands $70M As Defense Tech Heats Up\nParry Labs Raises $80M As Defense Tech Remains On A Tear\nChaos Industries Locks Up $145M Series B As Defense Tech Continues To Heat Up\nSaronic Latest Defense Tech Startup To Hit Unicorn Status\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

    "title": "Stealing Ghibli: How AI Has Crossed The Line Into Creative Theft",
    "content": "This, from her Instagram on Saturday, is Jaqueline Cristian, the top-ranked Romanian women‚Äôs professional tennis player and the 61st ranked woman player in the world.\n\nThis, a fan creation that Cristian uploaded to her Instagram, is also, evidently, Jaqueline Cristian, which is deeply problematic.\n\nLast week, the Studio Ghibli AI controversy entered our timelines, disgusting its founder and raising deep concerns about the state of intellectual property law and how it applies to the rapidly advancing world of artificial intelligence.\n\nIf an artist‚Äôs work ‚Äî especially one as distinctive and culturally significant as Studio Ghibli‚Äôs ‚Äî can be copied, modified and distributed by AI without consequence, then we may have crossed an irrevocable line. This situation does not merely present a challenge to copyright law but threatens to upend the entire foundation of how we define creative ownership.\n\nAt the heart of this issue is the question of what intellectual property law protects and how those protections apply when AI is involved.\nCopyright‚Äôs original intent\n\nCopyright law has traditionally shielded artistic works from unauthorized reproduction and distribution, ensuring that creators retain control over their intellectual and artistic output. Under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, which became the Paris Act in 1971, original works of authorship ‚Äî such as films, illustrations and designs ‚Äî are protected the moment they are created, requiring no formal registration.\n\nThis is the very law that safeguards the hand-drawn artistry of Studio Ghibli from being reproduced by others without authorization. However, these protections were drafted with human creators in mind, not machines that can be trained on millions of images and instantly generate works that mimic a particular style.\n\nOne of the key problems with AI-generated art is that while specific works are protected under copyright, style itself is not. Studio Ghibli‚Äôs films are a unique artistic canon, composed of thousands of unique illustrations, all of which are protected under copyright law. But an AI model that has been trained on these works can produce art that ‚Äúlooks like‚Äù a Studio Ghibli creation without directly copying a specific frame, such as in the AI creation of Jaqueline Cristian, above.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, this distinction creates a loophole that AI companies exploit. They argue that since the generated images are not direct copies, they do not infringe on copyright. This technicality makes it incredibly difficult for studios such as Ghibli to take legal action against AI-generated replicas.\n\nThis argument only addresses the letter of the law and ignores the spirit of intellectual property law, which exists to protect the originality of creative works and ensure that their creators receive recognition and control over how their work is used.\n\nThe entire premise of copyright is that those who invest time, effort and creativity into producing something original should not have their work taken, modified or commercialized by others without permission. AI-generated art that mimics Studio Ghibli‚Äôs distinct look undermines this principle by allowing machines ‚Äî and the companies that operate them ‚Äî to benefit from the studio‚Äôs decades of artistic innovation without any form of compensation or credit.\n\nThere is a very strong argument that the process by which AI learns to generate this type of artwork is itself legally questionable. AI models do not create in a vacuum; they are trained on massive datasets that include existing artworks, often scraped from the internet without permission from the original creators.\n\nMany AI companies claim that this practice falls under ‚Äúfair use,‚Äù a doctrine in copyright law that allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission under specific circumstances, such as for education, commentary or parody.\n\nHowever, fair use is not an absolute right, and courts evaluate it based on factors like the purpose of the use, the nature of the original work, the amount of the work used, and its effect on the market. AI companies that scrape copyrighted works without permission and then use them to generate art that competes with the originals in the marketplace may not meet the fair use standard.\nMimicry‚Äôs monetary consequences\n\nIn the case of Studio Ghibli, the AI-generated works are not being created for commentary or educational purposes ‚Äî they are being used to produce marketable images that mimic the studio‚Äôs signature aesthetic.\n\nThis could have a direct economic impact on Studio Ghibli and the artists who work within that style. If companies or individuals can generate Ghibli-style artwork without hiring a professional animator or illustrator, that undermines the value of Studio Ghibli‚Äôs brand and the livelihoods of artists who specialize in this form of art.\n\nCourts have historically ruled against uses of copyrighted material that create direct market competition with the original works. Where AI-generated Ghibli-style images interfere with the market for official Ghibli artwork and related licensed products, they should not be protected under fair use.\n\nAnother critical issue is the potential for misrepresentation and consumer confusion. Studio Ghibli has spent decades cultivating its distinctive artistic style, which is now synonymous with the studio‚Äôs brand identity.\nBlurred lines\n\nWhen AI-generated art replicates that style, it creates a risk that consumers may believe they are looking at an official Ghibli-sanctioned work when, in fact, they are not. In other words, this adds to the last thing we need in 2025 and beyond ‚Äî an enhanced inability to determine what is real and what is fake.\n\nThis brings trademark law into the equation. While copyright protects original works, trademarks protect brand identities ‚Äî including distinctive visual styles associated with a particular company. If AI-generated art misleads consumers into believing it is affiliated with Studio Ghibli, the studio could argue that this constitutes trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, which prohibits the unauthorized use of trademarks in a way that causes consumer confusion.\n\nThe reality is that enforcing these protections in the context of AI is very challenging. Most intellectual property laws were written before AI-generated content was even conceivable, meaning they do not provide clear guidance on how to handle situations where machines create works that closely resemble those of human artists.\n\nWe need legislative reform to close these loopholes and ensure that artists and studios retain control over their work in the age of AI. Some proposed solutions include requiring AI companies to obtain explicit permission before using copyrighted works in training datasets, establishing clearer rules around the commercial use of AI-generated art, and developing new forms of intellectual property protection that apply specifically to artistic styles.\nDevaluing human creativity\n\nThe Studio Ghibli controversy is not an isolated case ‚Äî it is part of a much larger debate about the role of AI in creative industries. From visual art to music to literature, AI is increasingly being used to generate content that competes with human-made works. If left unchecked, this could lead to a future in which human creativity is devalued, and artists find themselves unable to protect their own work from being absorbed and regurgitated by machines.\n\nIf we really think about it with some depth, intellectual property law is, at its core, about balance. IP law should seek to encourage innovation and creativity while ensuring that creators are fairly compensated for their work.\n\nAI has the potential to be a powerful tool for artists, but only if its use is governed by ethical and legal safeguards that respect the rights of original creators. The ability of AI to replicate Studio Ghibli‚Äôs art style without permission represents a dangerous step toward a world where artistic innovation can be freely harvested by machines, with little regard for the people behind it. If we fail to address these issues now, we risk eroding the foundations of intellectual property law and, with it, the incentive for human artists to continue pushing the boundaries of creativity.\n\nThe danger is not just that AI can copy Ghibli today ‚Äî it is that, if unchecked, AI will soon be able to replicate any artist‚Äôs work, making originality meaningless. We are standing on the precipice of a world where anything can be copied, tweaked and sold without regard for who originally created it.\n\nIf we allow that to happen, we will have fundamentally changed what it means to be an artist. And once we cross that line, there may be no going back.\n\nAron Solomon is the chief strategy officer for Amplify.

    "title": "How 3D printing could make better cooling systems",
    "content": "A new 3D-printed design could make an integral part of cooling systems like air conditioners or refrigerators smaller and more efficient, according to new research. \n\nHeat exchangers are devices that whisk away heat, and they‚Äôre everywhere‚Äîused in data centers, ships, factories, and buildings. The aim is to pass as much heat as possible from one side of the device to the other. Most use one of a few standard designs that have historically been easiest and cheapest to make. \n\n‚ÄúHeat exchangers are at the center of the industrial economy. They‚Äôre an essential part of every machine and every system that moves energy,‚Äù says William King, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and one of the authors of the new study. Existing designs tend to favor straight lines, right angles, and round tubes, he adds. \n\nKing and his colleagues used 3D printing to design a heat exchanger that includes features to optimize heat movement, like wavy walls and pyramid-shaped bumps, which wouldn‚Äôt be possible to make using traditional manufacturing techniques. \n\nThe team had set out to design a system based on a common refrigerant called R-134a, which is commonly used in devices like air conditioners and refrigerators. When cold water lowers the temperature of the refrigerant, it changes from a gas to a liquid on its path through the device. That liquid refrigerant can then go on to other parts of the cooling system, where it‚Äôs used to lower the temperature of anything from a room to a rack of servers. \n\nThe best way to cool the refrigerant tends to involve building very thin walls between the two sides of the device and maximizing the amount of contact that the water and the refrigerant make with those walls. (Think about how much colder you‚Äôd get wearing a thin T-shirt and pants and lying down on ice than simply touching it with your gloved hands.)\n\nTo design the best possible heat exchanger, researchers used simulations and developed machine-learning models to help predict the performance of different designs under different conditions. After 36,000 simulations, the researchers landed on the one they decided to develop.\n\nAmong the key components: small fins that jut out on the side of the device that touches the water, increasing the surface area to maximize heat transfer. The team also designed wavy passageways for the water to pass through‚Äîonce again helping to maximize surface area. Simulations helped the researchers figure out exactly how curvy the passages should be and where precisely to place the fins.\n\nOn the side of the devices where the refrigerant passes through, the design includes small pyramid-shaped bumps along the walls. These not only maximize the area for cooling but also help mix the refrigerant as it passes through and prevent liquid from coating the wall (which would slow down the heat transfer).\n\nAfter settling on a design, the researchers used a 3D-printing technique called direct metal laser sintering, in which lasers melt and fuse together a metal powder (in this case, an aluminum alloy), layer by layer.\n\nIn testing, the researchers found that the heat exchanger created with this technique was able to cool down the refrigerant more efficiently than other designs. The new device was able to achieve a power density of over six megawatts per meter cubed‚Äîoutperforming one common traditional design, the shell-tube configuration, by between 30% and 50% with the same pumping power. The device‚Äôs power density was similar to that of brazed plate heat exchangers, another common design in industry. \n\nOverall, this device doesn‚Äôt dramatically outperform the state-of-the-art technology, but the technique of using modeling and 3D printing to produce new heat exchanger designs is promising, says Dennis Nasuta, director of research and development at Optimized Thermal Systems, a consulting firm that works with companies in the HVAC industry on design and research. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs worth exploring, and I don‚Äôt think that we know yet where we can push it,‚Äù Nasuta says.\n\nOne challenge is that today, additive manufacturing techniques such as laser sintering are slow and expensive compared with traditional manufacturing; they wouldn‚Äôt be economical or feasible to rely on for all our consumer cooling devices, he says. For now, this type of approach could be most useful in niche applications like aerospace and high-end automotives, which could more likely bear the cost, he adds. \n\nThis particular study was funded by the US Office of Naval Research. Next-generation ships have more electronics aboard than ever, and there‚Äôs a growing need for compact and efficient systems to deal with all that extra heat, says Nenad Miljkovic, one of the authors of the study. \n\nEnergy demand for cooling buildings alone is set to double between now and 2050, and new designs could help efficiently meet the massive demand forecast for the coming decades. But challenges including manufacturing costs would need to be overcome to help innovations like the one designed by King and his team make a dent in real devices.\n\nAnother barrier to adopting these new techniques, Nasuta says, is that current standards don‚Äôt demand more efficiency. Other technologies already exist that could help make our devices more efficient, but they‚Äôre not used for the same reason. \n\nIt will take time for new manufacturing techniques, including 3D printing, to trickle into our devices, Natsua adds: ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt going to be in your AC next year.‚Äù",

    "content": "In the history of startup funding, SoftBank‚Äôs announcement yesterday that it is backing an investment of up to $40 billion in OpenAI is in a league of its own.\n\nNo other financing even comes close.\n\nThe next-closest was another OpenAI deal: Microsoft‚Äôs $10 billion financing in 2023. That was not a traditional startup financing round, however, as the money in it is to be paid over an extended period and includes a strategic partnership.\n\nMore recently, Databricks snagged a similarly sized growth round, confirming in January that it raised $10 billion at a $62 billion valuation.\n\nAfter that comes another SoftBank deal, a multifaceted 2019 WeWork financing totaling $9.5 billion. That deal, also unusually structured, ultimately proved unsuccessful as WeWork filed for bankruptcy four years later and re-emerged from the process last year.\nSoftBank‚Äôs OpenAI financing also has a quirky structure\n\nUnsurprisingly, the OpenAI deal announced today will not be a straightforward venture investment.\n\nRather, SoftBank plans to build a syndicate of co-investors to provide $10 billion of the total. SoftBank expects to fund the other $30 billion, with OpenAI reportedly expected to receive the full $40 billion by the end of the year.\n\nAs one would expect, the deal also sets a hefty valuation for 10-year-old OpenAI, contingent upon conditions for restructuring its for-profit subsidiary. When that happens, OpenAI will have a post-money valuation of $300 billion, per the agreement, making it by far the most valuable private, venture-backed company founded in the past 10 years.\nA historic period for high valuations\n\nThe Softbank-OpenAI tie-up comes amid a historic period for ultra-large startup financings at stratospheric valuations.\n\nCurrently, at least seven U.S. venture-backed, private companies have last reported valuations over $45 billion. Several are also reportedly on the verge of new financings at much higher values.\n\nHere are the frontrunners:\n\nSpaceX: Founded in 2002, Hawthorne, California-based SpaceX is no longer a startup. However, it is the most highly valued U.S. private, venture-backed company, hitting a reported $350 billion valuation in a secondary share sale late last year.\nStripe: Payments infrastructure provider Stripe, based in South San Francisco, garnered a $91.5 billion valuation for a tender offer it announced with the aim of providing liquidity to current and former employees.\nxAI: The last round for 2-year-old xAI was a $6 billion November Series C at a reported $50 billion valuation. However, last week Elon Musk said xAI, will buy¬†X, the social media platform he also owns formerly known as Twitter, for $33 billion in an all-stock transaction that values xAI at $80 billion.\nDatabricks: San Francisco data analytics platform Databricks confirmed in January that it completed a previously announced $10 billion in Series J equity financing at a $62 billion valuation.\nAnthropic: The generative AI heavyweight secured a $61.5 billion valuation in March when it raised $3.5 billion in a round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners.\nWaymo: Alphabet‚Äôs autonomous driving spinoff closed a $5.6 billion Series C last summer at a reported valuation of $45 billion.\n\nA long cycle\n\nThe trend of ever-rising valuations for private venture-backed companies is showing some longevity. While in the past, companies felt pressure to go public or find some other exit avenue after crossing a certain valuation threshold, investors today seem more willing to hold private company shares for an extended period.\n\nLooking at how the values of many of these shares have grown in recent quarters, it hasn‚Äôt worked out too badly.\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman\n\nClarification: An earlier version of this story misstated xAI&#8217;s valuation and excluded Databricks from the initial ranking of largest deals.",

    "title": "Private Equity In Flux: How Tariffs, AI And Infrastructure Define A New Investment Era",
    "content": "By Kevin Smith\n\nThe private equity landscape is experiencing transformative changes due to evolving market dynamics and the new U.S. presidential administration. Political shifts usher in a wave of both risks and opportunities that firms must adeptly navigate to sustain their competitive edge and seize emerging trends.\n\nInvestor confidence has fluctuated due to recent economic changes. Initially, there was a confident boost as investors anticipated stability and clarity from the new leadership. However, the reality of the Trump administration‚Äôs policies has introduced new uncertainties, particularly regarding tariffs and regulatory changes.\nImpact of tariffs and infrastructure investments\nKevin Smith of Wipfli\n\nOne of the most significant risks for PE in the current political climate is the imposition of tariffs.\n\nThe administration‚Äôs focus on repatriating manufacturing and imposing tariffs on imports, particularly from China, poses challenges for investments. While PE is somewhat sheltered from tariffs due to its focus on intellectual property and service investments, the dependency on lower-grade chips from China remains a concern.\n\nDespite these risks, the new administration‚Äôs emphasis on infrastructure development presents a substantial opportunity. The need for enhanced infrastructure to support manufacturing repatriation and the continued development of artificial intelligence and data centers creates a favorable environment for long-term PE investments.\n\nThe administration‚Äôs policies aim to make America a manufacturing center, necessitating significant infrastructure investments.\n\nHowever, the cost of capital is a critical factor that cannot be overlooked. With interest rates remaining high or potentially increasing, capital remains very expensive.\n\nThis presents a double-edged sword. On one hand, there is a significant opportunity to invest in infrastructure due to the high demand for manufacturing facilities, data centers, power sources and an enhanced power grid. On the other, tariffs increase the costs of the materials necessary to build the infrastructure needed, and immigration policies may drive up labor costs for construction jobs.\nGreen energy and environmental policies\n\nCurrent green energy and environmental policies introduce both risks and opportunities for PE firms. The slowdown in green energy investments doesn‚Äôt just affect wind farms or the environment ‚Äî it also impacts the technology companies that serve these areas.\n\nPE firms, which are often overweighted in intellectual property, technology and service sectors, face risks due to this slowdown.\n\nThe potential reduction in federal funding for programs such as the Rural Energy for America Program, managed by the USDA, poses further challenges. This funding, which is currently directed toward green energy for rural areas, is now in jeopardy. The potential discontinuation of this funding contributes to overall market uncertainty.\n\nThe demographic shift during this new administration has a significant effect on the availability of capital. As baby boomers retire, they are taking money out of the market and putting it into safer investments like T-bills, CDs and municipal bonds. This shift reduces the amount of capital available for deployment.\nDeregulation and AI investments\n\nThe emphasis on AI and deregulation creates a promising environment for PE investments. These policies could drive firms to invest in AI technologies aimed at enhancing efficiencies within government agencies and improving digital health services. By leveraging these advancements and the administration‚Äôs support, firms can capitalize on the rapid growth of AI technology and the resulting economic opportunities.\n\nPE bets in AI have been fewer but much bigger, leading to some risk in concentration. The heavy investment in AI, coupled with deregulation, suggests that this sector may see significant growth. However, it also means that the stakes are high, and the outcomes could be polarized, with some companies emerging as big winners and others potentially facing losses.\nStrategies for navigating uncertainty\n\nIn times of political and economic uncertainty, PE firms must adopt strategies to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities. One effective approach is to de-risk investments by putting follow-on rounds into entities they are already involved with or taking minority positions in companies that are already growing. This strategy reduces the risk associated with new ventures and leverages existing relationships and investments.\n\nPE firms may see more syndicated deals, where multiple funds come together to make an investment rather than a single fund making the entire investment. Syndicated raises can help spread risk and increase the chances of success, as they involve collaboration and shared expertise among multiple investors.\n\nThe PE sector has demonstrated resilience in the face of various challenges. It has survived inflation, tariffs and other economic disruptions, showcasing its flexibility in where money gets placed. When business is good, the PE market thrives, and even when business is bad, the sector performs relatively well. This adaptability and resilience make PE a robust investment option in both favorable and challenging times.\n\nKevin Smith is a partner and the national leader of Wipfli‚Äôs Technology and Innovation Industry. In this role, Smith aligns Wipfli‚Äôs broad portfolio of consulting and financial services to accelerate growth for technology-centric clients. With a successful history of driving growth in private equity-held technology and professional service firms, Smith is uniquely attuned to opportunities and optimizations that provide immediate impact for scaling technology companies.\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

    "title": "Brain-computer interfaces face a critical test",
    "content": "Tech companies are always trying out new ways for people to interact with computers‚Äîconsider efforts like Google Glass, the Apple Watch, and Amazon‚Äôs Alexa. You‚Äôve probably used at least one.\n\nBut the most radical option has been tried by fewer than 100 people on Earth‚Äîthose who have lived for months or years with implanted brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs.\n\nImplanted BCIs are electrodes put in paralyzed people‚Äôs brains so they can use imagined movements to send commands from their neurons through a wire, or via radio, to a computer. In this way, they can control a computer cursor or, in few cases, produce speech. \n\nRecently, this field has taken some strides toward real practical applications. About 25 clinical trials of BCI implants are currently underway. And this year MIT Technology Review readers have selected these brain-computer interfaces as their addition to our annual list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies, published in January.\n\nBCIs won by a landslide to become the ‚Äú11th Breakthrough,‚Äù as we call it. It beat out three runners-up: continuous glucose monitors, hyperrealistic deepfakes, and methane-detecting satellites.\n\nThe impression of progress comes thanks to a small group of companies that are actively recruiting volunteers to try BCIs in clinical trials. They are Neuralink, backed by the world‚Äôs richest person, Elon Musk; New York‚Äìbased Synchron; and China‚Äôs Neuracle Neuroscience.¬†\n\nEach is trialing interfaces with the eventual goal of getting the field‚Äôs first implanted BCI approved for sale. \n\n‚ÄúI call it the translation era,‚Äù says Michelle Patrick-Krueger, a research scientist who carried out a detailed survey of BCI trials with neuroengineer Jose Luis Contreras-Vidal at the University of Houston. ‚ÄúIn the past couple of years there has been considerable private investment. That creates excitement and allows companies to accelerate.‚Äù\n\nThat‚Äôs a big change, since for years BCIs have been more like a neuroscience parlor trick, generating lots of headlines but little actual help to patients. \n\nPatrick-Krueger says the first time a person controlled a computer cursor from a brain implant was in 1998. That was followed by a slow drip-drip of tests in which university researchers would find a single volunteer, install an implant, and carry out studies for months or years.\n\nOver 26 years, Patrick-Krueger says, she was able to document a grand total of 71 patients who‚Äôve ever controlled a computer directly with their neurons. \n\nThat means you are more likely to be friends with a Mega Millions jackpot winner than know someone with a BCI.\n\nThese studies did prove that people could use their neurons to play Pong, move a robot arm, and even speak through a computer. But such demonstrations are of no practical help to people with paralysis severe enough to benefit from a brain-controlled computer, because these implants are not yet widely available. \n\n‚ÄúOne thing is to have them work, and another is how to actually deploy them,‚Äù says Contreras-Vidal. ‚ÄúAlso, behind any great news are probably technical issues that need to be addressed.‚Äù These include questions about how long an implant will last and how much control it offers patients.\n\nLarger trials from three companies are now trying to resolve these questions and set the groundwork for a real product.\n\nOne company, Synchron, uses a stent with electrodes on it that‚Äôs inserted into a brain vessel via a vein in the neck. Synchron has implanted its ‚Äústentrode‚Äù in 10 volunteers, six in the US and four in Australia‚Äîthe most simultaneous volunteers reported by any BCI group. \n\nThe stentrode collects limited brain signals, so it gives users only a basic on/off type of control signal, or what Synchron calls a ‚Äúswitch.‚Äù That isn‚Äôt going to let a paralyzed person use Photoshop. But it‚Äôs enough to toggle through software menus or select among prewritten messages.\n\nTom Oxley, Synchron‚Äôs CEO, says the advantage of the stentrode is that it is ‚Äúas simple as possible.‚Äù That, he believes, will make his brain-computer interface ‚Äúscalable‚Äù to more people, especially since installing it doesn‚Äôt involve brain surgery. \n\nSynchron might be ahead, but it‚Äôs still in an exploratory phase. A ‚Äúpivotal‚Äù study, the kind used to persuade regulators to allow sales of a specific version of the device, has yet to be scheduled. So there‚Äôs no timeline for a product. \n\nNeuralink, meanwhile, has disclosed that three volunteers have received its implant, the N1, which consists of multiple fine electrode threads inserted directly into the brain through a hole drilled in the skull. \n\nMore electrodes mean more neural activity is captured. Neuralink‚Äôs first volunteer, Noland Arbaugh, has shown off how he can guide a cursor around a screen in two dimensions and click, letting him play video games like Civilization or online chess.\n\nFinally, Neuracle says it is running two trials in China and one in the US. Its implant consists of a patch of electrodes placed on top of the brain. In a report, the company said a paralyzed volunteer is using the system to stimulate electrodes in his arm, causing his hand to close in a grasp. \n\nBut details remain sparse. A Neuracle executive would only say that ‚Äúseveral‚Äù people had received its implant.\n\nBecause Neuracle‚Äôs patient count isn‚Äôt public, it wasn‚Äôt included in Patrick-Krueger‚Äôs tally. In fact, there‚Äôs no information at all in the medical literature on about a quarter of brain-implant volunteers so far, so she counted them using press releases or by e-mailing research teams.\n\nHer BCI survey yielded other insights. According to her data, implants have lasted as long as 15 years, more than half of patients are in the US, and roughly 75% of BCI recipients have been male. \n\nThe data can‚Äôt answer the big question, though. And that is whether implanted BCIs will progress from breakthrough demonstrations into breakout products, the kind that help many people.\n\n‚ÄúIn the next five to 10 years, it‚Äôs either going to translate into a product or it‚Äôll still stay in research,‚Äù Patrick-Krueger says. ‚ÄúI do feel very confident there will be a breakout.‚Äù",

So the team turned to transcripts of therapy sessions. ‚ÄúThis is actually how a lot of psychotherapists are trained,‚Äù Jacobson says. \n\nThat approach was better, but it had limitations. ‚ÄúWe got a lot of ‚Äòhmm-hmms,‚Äô ‚Äògo ons,‚Äô and then ‚ÄòYour problems stem from your relationship with your mother,‚Äô‚Äù Jacobson says. ‚ÄúReally tropes of what psychotherapy would be, rather than actually what we‚Äôd want.‚Äù\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt until the researchers started building their own data sets using examples based on cognitive behavioral therapy techniques that they started to see better results. It took a long time. The team began working on Therabot in 2019, when OpenAI had released only its first two versions of its GPT model. Now, Jacobson says, over 100 people have spent more than 100,000 human hours to design this system. \n\nThe importance of training data suggests that the flood of companies promising therapy via AI models, many of which are not trained on evidence-based approaches, are building tools that are at best ineffective, and at worst harmful.¬†\n\nLooking ahead, there are two big things to watch: Will the dozens of AI therapy bots on the market start training on better data? And if they do, will their results be good enough to get a coveted approval from the US Food and Drug Administration? I‚Äôll be following closely.

As of August &#8212; before reports of Google&#8217;s interest in the company first surfaced &#8212; the company&#8217;s shares were trading at just $2.81, down from their high in the summer of 2015 of $51.90 per share. The move amps up the wearables race. It&#8217;s also causing some consternation over Google collecting even more data about us. Then again, who wears their Fitbit for more than a few weeks before relegating it the drawer full of Post-It notes and unused phrase books?

The software will also be sector-specific when it&#8217;s released more widely in the first quarter of next year.¬†\n\nThe company first came together this past summer led by Petraeus, who joined the U.S. Reserve Officers&#8217; Training Corps to help defray the cost of her Ivy League education and wound up spending seven years in the U.S. Army, including as a civil affairs officer, before co-founding an online meals marketplace, then spending a year with McKinsey & Co. to get a better handle on how businesses are run.¬†\n\nPetraeus says that across her experience, and particularly in the Army, she had &#8220;great leaders&#8221; who were &#8220;thoughtful about their [reports&#8217;] development goals and what was happening in their personal lives, and brought out the best in their people, rather than making them feel less than or marginalized.&#8221;¬†\n\nStill, she was aware that from an institutional standpoint, most harassment training is not thoughtful, that it&#8217;s a matter of checking boxes on an annual basis to ensure compliance with different state laws, depending on where an organization is headquartered. She marveled that so much of the content employees are consuming seems &#8220;designed for a 1980s law firm.&#8221;¬†\n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nCasstime, a four-year-old, Shenzhen, China-based auto aftermarket procurement platform, has raised $80 million in Series C-1 funding co-led by¬†Sequoia Capital China¬†and¬†Source Code Capital, with participation from earlier backer¬†Hua Partners.

But I also knew from our own experience in struggling to raise money the need for more capital in Utah, and I thought having that operator-entrepreneur perspective could be useful.‚Äù¬†\n\nA first fund, like many in the industry, was more of an experiment, though it was a decent $23 million, thanks largely to the support of Chegg CEO Dan Rosensweig, who was early to commit capital to the fund. A second ($56 million) fund followed when Krommenhoek and John Mayfield ‚Äî a friend who joined him from a marketing role at Qualtrics ‚Äî began investing more seriously in their backyard and beyond.¬†\n\nThey were soon joined by a third investor, Diogo Myrrha, who began as a principal with the firm and is now a general partner.

Then he really began to bounce around. Park worked as a trader in New York out of college, embraced the ski-bum life in Utah, then headed to Asia for Uber, where he spent six years, running its expansion team, then managing its entire Southeast Asia business out of Singapore.¬†\n\nMore specifically, he was responsible for eight countries across the region, and 350 people, which didn‚Äôt give him a lot of time to organize his home. But he wasn‚Äôt overwhelmed by the chaos. Instead, he says that in Singapore, something unusual happened. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this huge culture of landlords furnishing space to attract expats,‚Äù explains Park. ‚ÄúThe furnishings aren‚Äôt super high-end, but they‚Äôre well-designed and well put together, and it enabled me to be basically moved in as soon as I put my clothes in the closet.‚Äù Suddenly, coming home was a treat ‚Äî a new sensation for him. ‚ÄúFor the first time, I was proud to host friends for dinners and barbecues and to just open the door and relax.‚Äù¬†\n\nPark knew his U.S. friends could benefit from the same experience, and before long, he was talking with his Dartmouth classmate turned product and industrial designer Christian Talmage about forming their own company. Enter Oliver Space, which provides a lot of what that Singaporean landlord delivered to Park. It furnishes places for busy professionals, making moving into a new home as easy as hanging up their clothes.¬†\n\nThe now year-old service is available in the Bay Area only. And Oliver Space employs just a dozen people so far. But the company has already gained enough traction to attract $6.8 million in seed funding from an interesting array of investors, including Mayfield, Abstract Ventures, investors Jana Messerschmidt and April Underwood, Opendoor founder Eric Wu, and Kevin and Julia Hartz of Eventbrite, among others.¬†\n\nNow, Oliver Space just has to grow as quickly, or more so, than other furniture-as-service startups to recently attract funding.¬†\n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nGreensill, an eight-year-old, London-based provider of working capital and supply chain finance, has raised $655 million in new funding from earlier¬†backer¬†SoftBank Vision Fund.

The company cited the cost of new employees, but as the WSJ notes, Alphabet‚Äôs equity investments also seemingly played a role, with Alphabet reporting paper losses of $1.53 billion from such investments, compared with gains of $1.38 billion a year earlier.

[Throws frisbee into tree.] \n\nBefore we dive into the newsletter, one more bit of great news about our upcoming event (which we promise we&#8217;ll stop talking about soon): Michael Grimes, the star tech banker from Morgan Stanley at the center of Uber&#8217;s IPO (and Facebook IPO, and Slack&#8217;s and Spotify&#8217;s), has been persuaded to come and talk about direct listings, which we&#8217;re very excited about. If you&#8217;re as confused as we are about whether these make sense for more than a couple of companies each year (current status: we don&#8217;t think they do), you won&#8217;t want to miss this rare conversation with &#8220;Wall Street&#8217;s Silicon Valley whisperer.&#8221; \n\nNote that seats are almost gone.

The contract could be worth as much as $10 billion over a decade. Donald Trump had expressed opposition to giving the lucrative award to a company led by sometimes nemesis Jeff Bezos, who has suggested sending Trump into space. In a statement announcing the award, the Defense Department said: ‚ÄúThe acquisition process was conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.‚Äù All parties ‚Äúwere treated fairly and evaluated consistently with the solicitation‚Äôs stated evaluation criteria,‚Äù said the statement. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre surprised about this conclusion,‚Äù Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said in a separate statement. ‚ÄúAWS is the clear leader in cloud computing, and a detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings clearly lead to a different conclusion.‚Äù The Washington Post has more here.\n\nSponsored By . . .\n\nGot funding?

Let&#8217;s talk.\n\nVC Ben Horowitz on WeWork, Uber and One Cultural Value His Employees Can&#8217;t Break\n\nBen Horowitz, the co-founder of the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, has a new book coming out this coming Monday titled ‚ÄúWhat You Do is Who You Are,‚Äù that takes a look at how to create ‚Äúculture‚Äù at a company. \n\nIt‚Äôs a word that‚Äôs thrown around a lot but that&#8217;s very hard to grasp, let alone implement in a sustainable way. Horowitz learned firsthand as a CEO how elusive it can be when he took stock of his company, only to discover it was made up of ‚Äúscreamers who intimidated their people,‚Äù others who ‚Äúneglected to give any feedback,‚Äù and at least one compulsive liar who excelled at sucking up to Horowitz and also making up stories from whole cloth. \n\nHorowitz says creating culture was a missing part of his education, and in this new book ‚Äî a follow-up to his best-selling ‚ÄúThe Hard Thing About Hard Things‚Äù ‚Äî he does his best to fill that gap for other CEOs, using his own experience, as well as lessons gleaned from historical figures Toussaint Louverture and Genghis Khan, along with Shaka Senghor, a contemporary who served time for murder and today is a criminal justice reform advocate. \n\nIt‚Äôs an instructive and novel combination, and we suggest picking up the book, especially if you love history. In the meantime, we sat down recently with Horowitz to talk about its timing and whether some of the biggest cultural blow-ups in the startup industry ‚Äî Uber and WeWork ‚Äî could have been avoided. These excerpts have been edited for length and clarity. Note that we‚Äôll have more of the conversation ‚Äî including Horowitz‚Äôs thoughts about dual-class shares ‚Äî for readers of Extra Crunch on Monday. \n\nYou‚Äôve just written a book about culture that‚Äôs coming out just as a lot of questions are being raised about culture because of WeWork. What happened there? \n\n[Cofounder Adam Neumann] had a certain kind of culture there. He had some holes ‚Äî some great strengths and great holes. And sometimes that happens. When you‚Äôre really good at part of it, you can delude yourself into thinking that you‚Äôve got everything you need when you have some massive incompleteness. \n\nAdam is so amazing. Like, the way they got all the money and everything. And the vision was so spectacular. And everybody there believed it, and they recruited some phenomenal talent. But when you‚Äôre that optimistic, it does help to have something in the culture that says [allows] people to bring you the bad news, like, if the accounting is all over the place or what have you. \n\nAs with Uber‚Äôs Travis Kalanick, whose culture also came under fire, Neumann operated in very plain sight. He wasn‚Äôt hiding who he was or what he was spending. \n\nRight, everybody knew how Travis was running the company. Everyone in Silicon Valley knew, let alone everyone on the board. The culture was published. You can look up Uber‚Äôs values [from that period]. \n\nTravis designed, I think, a really compelling culture, and believed in it, and published it. And the consequences of what he was missing were also super well-known. It‚Äôs only when board members think people are coming after them that [they take an interest in these things]. \n\nWhat are the biggest lessons in these two cases? \n\nI obviously know more about Uber [as a Lyft investor who follows the space]. In Uber‚Äôs case, it‚Äôs a very subtle thing. Travis had a really good code. But he had a bug in it. \n\nI think it was reported that, like, Travis encouraged bad behavior. I don‚Äôt think he did at all. I just think he didn‚Äôt make it clear that legal and ethical [considerations] were more important than competitiveness. As a result, when left to their own devices, in a distributed organization where there was a lot of distributed power, that combination had people doing things that were out of bounds. \n\nAnd he was making everybody so much money. And the company was growing so fast that, for the board members, I suspect they were like, ‚ÄòAs long as it‚Äôs making money, I‚Äôm not going to worry about what happens next.‚Äô \n\nTo me, the unfair part is, like, they shouldn‚Äôt get any credit at the end. Whatever you‚Äôre blaming Travis for [you should blame them, too] because they didn‚Äôt see it, either. I think that‚Äôs a charitable way of putting it. \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nFountain Medical, a 12-year-old, Beijing, China-based contract research organization for pharma, has raised $62 million in Series D funding led by Goldman Sachs, with participation from Lilly Asia Ventures.

There‚Äôs no more days needed to go fundraising. There‚Äôs no more days needed to go prove to the investor community that we‚Äôre a viable company. The size of the commitment that SoftBank has made to this company in the past and now is $18.5 billion. To put the things in context, that is bigger than the GDP of my country where I came from.

Over the years, we&#8217;ve mistakenly believed that a number of founders have obtained specific college degrees based on their LinkedIn bio, only to learn offline that they enrolled for some period of time in a particular program that they didn&#8217;t complete. \n\nIt happened most recently with the cofounder of a startup who one would might surmise based on his LinkedIn profile has a master&#8217;s degree from Harvard but does not. We also misunderstood the CEO of a robotics company to have a PhD based on her LinkedIn. It was our fault; it mentioned under the credit that she&#8217;d left to start a company. But anyone scanning the site might have come to the same wrong conclusion.

Headquartered in Austin with senior-level talent in San Francisco, we are a PR agency with expertise in funding launches. Our VC Portfolio Funding Launch Accelerator Program is a 5-week sprint that ensures your funding news gets the business & tech press coverage it deserves. Beyond funding, we collaborate with both startups and enterprises to meet your business goals (with 15 exits under our belt). Interested? Let&#8217;s talk.\n\nHave We Reached the Tipping Point?\n\nLimited partners or LPs &#8212; the pension funds, the university endowments, the family offices that largely provide venture firms with their spending money &#8212; are receiving a lot of attention from venture capitalists, some of it unwanted. VCs have begun knocking down their doors with requests for fresh capital commitments so they&#8217;ll have money to invest if the market cools down. \n\nThe problem is, many of these LPs are already over-allocated. LPs traditionally invest in many asset classes, such as public equities, and they allocate a small percentage of their portfolio to venture capital. Suddenly, they&#8217;re finding they&#8217;ve forked over more than they&#8217;d intended to VCs. \n\nThere are several reasons for this situation. First, VCs are returning to them ever faster for more capital &#8212; sometimes in less than two years&#8217; time &#8212; because they are in vesting at such a furious pace. \n\nCompounding the problem, not all LPs have received returns from their VC investments that they can recycle into new venture capital allocations. In some cases, this capital is still tied up in startups that are raising much more money than in the past and staying private longer. &#8220;We have some large exposures to blue chip names where IPOs have been rumored to be coming for a long time already, and now it&#8217;s maybe 2021, maybe 2022,&#8221; says one manager who asked not to be named. In other cases where startups have gone public, falling prices have prompted VCs to hang on to their shares instead of distribute them. \n\nThe result is that LPs are having to cut back on the number of managers they can fund, and that could mean bad news for venture capitalists and startups alike. These LPs don&#8217;t have much choice. As the LP explains it, &#8220;We have a pretty structured allocation process, and we&#8217;re really trying to be creative,&#8221; she says. One venture manager who reappeared too quickly for more money was &#8220;easy to walk away from,&#8221; says this person. &#8220;Others, we&#8217;re having to do financial backflips for them to remain strong partners.&#8221; Either way, this LP adds, &#8220;We can&#8217;t add any new relationships right now,&#8221; meaning new venture teams in particular are out of luck. &#8220;When [VCs] shorten their fundraising cycle by nine months to a year, you can only squeeze the balloon so much.&#8221; \n\nSoftBank&#8217;s $100 billion &#8220;Vision Fund&#8221; is one big reason LPs find themselves in their current predicament. From the moment SoftBank began waving money around several years ago, it launched a vicious cycle. According to Chris Douvos, whose investment firm, Ahoy Capital, owns stakes in such venture funds as True Ventures and First Round Capital, &#8220;When Andreessen Horowitz hit the scene a decade ago, they changed the tempo of investing and everyone got more aggressive in their dealmaking as a response. Then SoftBank entered the picture in a big way, and it was like a16z on steroids.&#8221; \n\nMore here.\n\nMassive Fundings\n\nBlueground, a six-year-old, New York-based startup providing turnkey flexible rental apartments, has raised $50 million in Series B funding, roughly six months after raising $20 million in Series A funding.

    "title": "Twitter User Claims TradingView Has Ignored a Fibonacci Retracement Bug for 5 Years",
    "content": "Update: the CTO of TradingView told Cointelegraph in comments that the reports of a bug were inaccurate, and the Twitter user partially withdrew his earlier claims that the tool was broken. Popular chart analysis service TradingView reportedly contains a bug in the Fibonacci retracement technical analysis tool, according to a tweet by self-proclaimed certified Elliott wave analyst Cryptoteddybear published on June 13. The Elliott wave principle is a type of technical analysis for predicting prices in financial markets by looking at recurring patterns. In a video that he uploaded to YouTube, the analyst explains that the tool does linear calculations when in logarithmic charts, which he notes is a significant issue for Elliot wave traders. The official Twitter account of the company behind the charting service answered his tweet, announcing that the issue is being investigated, to which Cryptoteddybear answered: &ldquo;Thank you @tradingview for finally taking this issue seriously.&rdquo; The first reports of the bug, posted over five years ago (in November 2014) on consumer community platform getsatisfaction, have been reportedly ignored by the company. Another report submitted on the same platform, dated June 3, 2017, has seen the official TradingView account answer in the thread: &ldquo;Hi, you are right, we have a planned task to fix this. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.&rdquo; However, the problem apparently has not yet been solved. Cryptoteddybear claims that a company representative told him that he asked the technicians to increase the priority given to solving the bug. As Cointelegraph recently reported, TradingView is one of the platforms that added the &ldquo;CIX100&rdquo; index &mdash; an AI-powered index for the 100 strongest-performing cryptocurrencies and tokens. At the beginning of the current month, cryptocurrency analytics company Coin Metrics announced that it has acquired digital asset index firm Bletchley Indexes and plans to launch crypto smart beta indexes. As of press time, TradingView has not responded to a request for comment.",
